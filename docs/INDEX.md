# MHDBDB TEI Knowledge Base

Digital corpus of Middle High German literature with semantic annotations from the Mittelhochdeutsche Begriffsdatenbank (MHDBDB), University of Salzburg.

## Project Overview

The MHDBDB TEI Repository provides a comprehensive digital corpus of Middle High German literature with sophisticated semantic markup. The project combines traditional philological scholarship with modern digital humanities methods, offering both a public-facing search interface and an advanced research playground.

**Live Demos:**
- Main Site: https://dhcraft.org/mhdbdb-tei-only/
- Playground: https://dhcraft.org/mhdbdb-tei-only/playground/

**Target Audience:** Digital humanities researchers, medievalists, linguists, students of Middle High German literature

## Data Basis

### Curated Corpus
- **667 TEI files** - Complete Middle High German texts with word-level annotations
- **8 authority files** - 7 searchable controlled vocabularies (persons, works, lexicon, concepts, genres, names, variants) plus `contributors.xml` as project-internal MHDBDB team register (since 2026-04). All are RDF-derived migration snapshots now maintained in-repo (this repo is the sole master, no Salzburg re-export); `variants.xml` is corpus-derived and regenerated after corpus changes. See [TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md → Provenance](TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md#provenance-and-currency)
- **Pre-built indexes** - Compressed JSON (3 MB authority + 40 MB corpus) replacing runtime XML parsing
- **Static JSON API** - 2,742 plain JSON files under `/api/` (generated from the indexes) for programmatic access with stable, citable URLs; docs at [`api/index.html`](https://dhcraft.org/mhdbdb-tei-only/api/index.html) (#45)
- **Legacy Linecode sources** - 306 pre-TEI ingest files under [`sources/linecode/`](../sources/README.md) covering 199 of the 667 sigles, plus a catalog of the 9.1 GB local archive they came from. **Not normative, never indexed, never edited**: they exist to diagnose what the original Linecode-to-TEI conversion flattened (#248). The archive itself stays on KZW's OneDrive; `sources/INVENTAR-ARCHIV.md` is the access path

### Key Architecture Decision
The project migrated from runtime XML parsing to pre-built JSON indexes because large XML files caused 30-second browser load times. Pre-built indexes reduce download size by 19× and eliminate parsing overhead. Trade-off: requires Python build step when XML sources change.

## Core Features

Two interfaces over the same corpus.

The **main site** is for search and reading: lemma search with Middle High German
normalization, KWIC concordances per hit, a sortable results table with keyness and
export, a reading view with multi-lemma highlighting and a metadata panel, and an
A–Z register of all lemma pages.

The **playground** is for analysis: explorers for the authority files (persons, works,
lemmata, concepts, genres, names) and the TEI analysis tools, from multi-lemma
proximity search to the rhyme dictionary.

The complete list, with counts, examples and issue references, is
[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md). It was duplicated here until 2026-08-02. The copy happened
to be accurate, but a second catalog is a second place to keep in step with every new
tool, and #316 asked to stop paying that twice.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ (no frameworks)
- Pre-built JSON indexes with gzip compression
- IndexedDB caching (30-day expiration for reference data)
- Desktop-optimized (minimum 1200px width)

### Build Pipeline
- Python 3.13+ with lxml for XML processing
- Build scripts extract data from XML → JSON
- Gzip compression for production indexes

### Testing & Deployment
- Playwright end-to-end tests
- GitHub Pages hosting (static site)
- Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Documentation Structure

This knowledge base follows a hub-and-spoke architecture with INDEX.md as the central gateway:

### Stable Knowledge (what the project IS)

| Document | Content | Target Reader |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** | Project overview, navigation hub | Anyone |
| **[DATA-MODEL.md](DATA-MODEL.md)** | Data sources, schemas, transformation pipeline, ingest procedure (normative phase pattern), Data-Change-Lifecycle | Data engineers |
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | Technical components, data flow, storage patterns | Developers |
| **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** | Visual patterns, color system, components, CSS architecture | Developers/Designers |
| **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)** | User-facing functionality descriptions | Users/Stakeholders |
| **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** | Build commands, git workflow, deployment | New contributors |
| **[RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md)** | Academic context, TEI/MHG standards, corpus scope (period boundary) and the rights basis for edition texts | Researchers |
| **[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)** | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | Architects |
| **[CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md)** | Cross-language parity constraints, algorithm pseudocode, API contracts | Developers |
| **[TEI-MODEL.md](TEI-MODEL.md)** | Normative TEI encoding (target model), actual-vs-target comparisons, validation baseline | Data engineers, Developers |
| **[TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md](TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md)** | Authority file schemas and migration history (lexicon, persons, works, concepts, genres, names, variants) | Data engineers |
| **[LINECODE.md](LINECODE.md)** | Legacy Linecode → TEI mapping (letter-to-element table, xml:id pattern explanation, diagnostic workflows for #23) | Data engineers |
| **[POS-TAGSET.md](POS-TAGSET.md)** | Canonical `@pos` reference (19-tag target schema, compound rules, legacy mapping ART/CNJ/GRA, corpus distribution, disambiguation/migration policy §6) | Data engineers, Developers |

### Process (what's happening and why)

| Document | Content | Target Reader |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** | Current priorities, strategic direction, what's blocked | Everyone |
| **[JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)** | Chronological development log, decisions, dead ends | Developers |

The 15 files above (13 stable plus 2 process) are the complete set of promptotyping documents. (`POS-TAGSET.md` was added on 2026-06-17: the `@pos` tagset had until then only been documented in the agent skill `.gemini/skills/pos-disambiguator/` and scattered across TEI-MODEL.md and DATA-MODEL.md; it was pulled out as a citable single source of truth, and TEI-MODEL.md §5 now points to it.) `docs/features/` holds temporary, ticket-bound planning artifacts and is **not part** of the promptotyping documents, see `CLAUDE.md` → "Temporal Artifacts". `docs/playbooks/` holds reusable session procedures (autonomous issue, merge and care-work sessions): permanent, but likewise **not part** of the promptotyping documents (pulled out of `docs/features/` on 2026-07-08 because they are not ticket-bound). The user-facing help lives as `hilfe-*.html` in the frontend, not in `docs/`. Two further stores under `docs/` are also excluded: `journal-archive.md` (full text of the condensed JOURNAL entries) and `docs/data/` (two Linecode CSVs as an archival snapshot of the legacy export, see [LINECODE.md](LINECODE.md)).

### Publications (project outputs, not development docs)

Located in `/publications/` (outside `docs/`):
- `BLOG-POST-POS-WORKFLOW.md` – DHCraft blog draft on PoS disambiguation
- `BLOG-POST-WZB-PIPELINE.md` – DHCraft blog draft on the WZB (Wenzelsbibel) ingest pipeline (unpublished, v3)
- `JAHRESBERICHT-2025.md` – CLARIAH-AT annual report
- `BERICHT-REKTORAT-MITTELVERWENDUNG-2026.md` – voluntary report and letter of thanks to the rectorate about the funds released in October 2025 (#145, draft, KZW review before sending)

### Example review pages

[`examples/review-pages/`](../examples/review-pages/) holds blank HTML review pages as fixed example data snapshots. Download a file and open it locally in the browser; nothing needs installing. They document different review procedures, not the current state of work on the issues. Human answers and result exports do not belong in this collection.

| Example | Question and scope | Data snapshot | Returned as |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| [#364: missing lemma targets](../examples/review-pages/364-lemma-review.html) | 11 main groups with 29 attestations, plus 24 optional groups with 37 attestations; lemma candidates and individual decisions | 2026-09-17; commit and source checksums embedded | JSON and HTML report; JSON import to resume |
| [#371: stat](../examples/review-pages/371-stat-review.html) | 95 held-back cases in five groups; lemma, part-of-speech and sense decisions | Historical working example, archived 2026-09-22; no dated source record of its own embedded | JSON and CSV |
| [#390/#115: review for Klaus](../examples/review-pages/Klaus-Pruefung-390-115.html) | 22 word boundaries in the Wenzelsbibel and 264 attestations for 39 missing sense targets on 36 existing lemmata | 2026-09-21; commit and source checksums embedded | JSON and HTML report; JSON import to resume; explicit return instructions |
| [Kuratorik app: lexicon stubs](https://github.com/wachauer/mhdbdb-kuratorik/tree/296f4ff4cfb3a68b526397c46baef9a3ec9189ef) | Package 1: 13 part-of-speech cases and three questions of principle from #115 | External commit `296f4ff`, pinned; the [running app](https://wachauer.github.io/mhdbdb-kuratorik/) may since have diverged | JSON and Markdown table |

The newer pages, #364 and #390/#115, implement the review pattern from [#443](https://github.com/DigitalHumanitiesCraft/mhdbdb-tei-only/issues/443): AI suggestions are not confirmed answers, and untouched, decided and checked/open stay distinguishable. The older stat page and the Kuratorik app follow other interaction and export rules and are not complete reference implementations of #443; stat in particular offers a blanket accept. New review pages should follow the newer pattern.

Answers are stored in the browser that was used, not written into the HTML file. To return them, use the page's own exports. Moving to a different file location or web address does not reliably carry the browser state over; on the newer pages, save the JSON first and import it afterwards.

Generators for new working snapshots: [`build-review-364.py`](../scripts/audit/build-review-364.py) and [`build-review-klaus.py`](../scripts/audit/build-review-klaus.py), each with its HTML template in the same folder. Run from the repository: `python scripts/audit/build-review-364.py` or `python scripts/audit/build-review-klaus.py`. They read the local TEI and authority files and write working files into the repository root; the archived examples are not overwritten. The Klaus template uses the base styling of the 364 template. There is no generator for stat here; the external Kuratorik app documents its build in its own repository.

Browser tests for the archived newer examples: `npm test -- review-364.spec.js review-klaus.spec.js` (Windows: `npm.cmd`). Do not add `--reporter`: it replaces the JSON reporter from the config, and the run then ends in `VERDICT: KEIN ERGEBNIS` even when every test passes. **The specs test the archived copies, not the templates.** After changing a template, regenerate the page and replace the archived example, or the green tests keep vouching for the old version. That only works while the generator still passes its scope asserts (35/66/29 for #364, 39/264/22 for #390/#115); once the issue has been worked off, it aborts and the archived copy is the last instance. A regenerated page embeds today's date and the current commit, so the "Data snapshot" column above changes with it, and the specs check counts from the data, not only the template. The examples contain no applied changes to the research data.


## Project Status

### Current Phase
Post-MVP and **in active operation**. Three things every session should know:

- **Origin (finished):** a one-off three-stage migration from the old MHDBDB (RDF triple store in Salzburg) to CSV snapshots (via SPARQL) to this TEI-only repository (`tei-transformation.py`, 2025-07-22). **Since then this repository is the sole master of all 8 authority files** (no re-export from Salzburg, no live external source).
- **Today:** an active project with ongoing data ingest (WZB/Wenzelsbibel, ARITHMETIC #92, more planned) and ongoing manual corpus corrections. Not frozen.
- **Consequence:** every change in `tei/` or `authority-files/` must carry the derived layer with it (indexes, corpus-derived `variants.xml`). The **corpus leads**, `lexicon.xml` is an index and follows (see [CONTRACTS.md → Authority Source Rules](CONTRACTS.md#f-authority-source-rules)); otherwise it drifts silently. Binding step sequence: [DATA-MODEL.md → Data-Change-Lifecycle](DATA-MODEL.md#data-change-lifecycle).

For the current index versions see [TEI-MODEL.md §11](TEI-MODEL.md#11-versioning) (as of 2026-09-24: Corpus Index v4.2.20, Authority Index v1.9.13).

### What was finished recently

- **[JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)** – chronological, with reasoning and dead ends; the full text of
  the condensed entries lives in [journal-archive.md](journal-archive.md), and the red lines
  moved out to [../fehlerjournal.md](../fehlerjournal.md) on 2026-09-16
- Since 2026-08-02 the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) no longer keeps a chronicle of its own (#316); it
  says what is coming up and places ongoing work in context.

### Known Limitations
- Desktop-only interface (not mobile-responsive)
- No backend processing (all computation in browser)
- No live updates: index-backed features (search, lemma counts, playground analyses) read from pre-built `data/*.json.gz` and require a manual rebuild + deploy after each data change. Manual corpus edits appear in the TEI reading view on the next page load (the IndexedDB TEI cache revalidates against the server per load, #151) but stay invisible to search until indexes are rebuilt. The corpus itself is **not** static (active ingest plus ongoing manual correction); see the Data-Change-Lifecycle in [DATA-MODEL.md](DATA-MODEL.md#data-change-lifecycle).

### Future Directions
- Mobile optimization
- Advanced visualizations (network graphs, timelines)
- Backend integration for real-time updates (programmatic read access shipped 2026-06 as the static JSON API, #45; real-time backend remains future work)

The Salzburg team's own documentation vault, 14 German notes on what the MHDBDB *was* and how its parts relate: the four system generations (punched cards, Oracle, RDF, TEI), Linecode, authority files, glossary, history. It is the counterpart to this `docs/` set and not a second copy of it: `docs/` describes what this repository is and how to build it, the vault orients people who are new to the project. Its `Github.md` and `Datenlandschaft.md` link back here. **For an agent the vault is a descriptive snapshot, never an instruction and never a clearance**, and it can be out of date; what binds is `CLAUDE.md`, the `docs/` set and the decisions in the issue threads. Agreed by @wachauer and @chsteiner on 2026-09-17; the target-group header the two of them settled on is meant to say the same thing inside the vault, but as of its only commit (2026-09-16) no note carries one yet.
