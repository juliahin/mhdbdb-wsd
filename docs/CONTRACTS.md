# Cross-System Contracts

Technical contracts that bind Python (build-time) and JavaScript (runtime) together. Breaking any of these causes silent data corruption – search returns wrong results, highlights land on wrong words, or caches serve stale data.

**Why this document exists:** These constraints span multiple files and languages. No single module owns them. They are the most dangerous knowledge to lose because violations produce no error messages – just silently wrong behavior.

> **Audience:** This file is a technical reference specification, written primarily for development and automated tooling (precise, machine-oriented).

## A. MHG Normalization Parity

**Contract:** `scripts/mhg_normalizer.py` and `assets/js/lib/text-normalizer.js` MUST produce identical output for all inputs.

**Why:** Build scripts normalize lemma forms when creating the authority index. The browser normalizes user search input at runtime. If the two normalizations diverge, indexed terms won't match runtime queries – search appears broken with no error.

**Parity test:** `testing/tests/normalization-parity.spec.js`

### Transformation Rules (ordered – order matters)

| Step | Operation | Characters | Result | JS | Python |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|--------|
| 0 | Unicode-Komposition | o + U+0308 | ö | `.normalize('NFC')` | `unicodedata.normalize('NFC', …)` |
| 0 | | o + U+0306 | ŏ | dito | dito |
| 1 | Lowercase | all | lowercase | `.toLowerCase()` | `.lower()` |
| 2 | Long vowels (circumflex + macron) | â ā | a | `/[âā]/g` | `.replace('â','a').replace('ā','a')` |
| 2 | | ê ē | e | `/[êē]/g` | `.replace('ê','e').replace('ē','e')` |
| 2 | | î ī | i | `/[îī]/g` | `.replace('î','i').replace('ī','i')` |
| 2 | | ô ō | o | `/[ôō]/g` | `.replace('ô','o').replace('ō','o')` |
| 2 | | û ū | u | `/[ûū]/g` | `.replace('û','u').replace('ū','u')` |
| 3 | Umlauts → digraphs | ä | ae | `/ä/g` | `.replace('ä','ae')` |
| 3 | | ö | oe | `/ö/g` | `.replace('ö','oe')` |
| 3 | | ü | ue | `/ü/g` | `.replace('ü','ue')` |
| 3 | Breve-Umlaute (WZB, #224) | ŏ | oe | `/ŏ/g` | `.replace('ŏ','oe')` |
| 3 | | ŭ | ue | `/ŭ/g` | `.replace('ŭ','ue')` |
| 3 | Breve als Schreibkonvention (WZB, ADR-017) | w + U+0306 | w | `/w̆/g` | `.replace('w̆','w')` |

| 4 | | œ | oe | `/œ/g` | `.replace('œ','oe')` |
| 5 | Special | ǒ | o | `/ǒ/g` | `.replace('ǒ','o')` |

### Test Cases

These 26 cases must pass in both languages (the `None` case is Python-only, so the JS list has 25). Source: `scripts/mhg_normalizer.py` → `TEST_CASES`, mirrored in `testing/tests/normalization-parity.spec.js`

| Input | Expected | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `brôt` | `brot` | ô → o (circumflex, NOT umlaut) |
| `BRÔT` | `brot` | Uppercase + circumflex |
| `wîn` | `win` | î → i |
| `vriunt` | `vriunt` | No special characters – passthrough |
| `schône` | `schone` | ô → o (circumflex – NOT ö → oe) |
| `schöne` | `schoene` | ö → oe (actual umlaut) |
| `Âventiure` | `aventiure` | Uppercase Â → lowercase → a |
| `mære` | `maere` | æ → ae (ligature) |
| `âne` | `ane` | â → a |
| `fröude` | `froeude` | ö → oe |
| `müede` | `mueede` | ü → ue, existing e remains → "mueede" |
| `ûzer` | `uzer` | û → u |
| `ōre` | `ore` | ō → o (macron) |
| `sǒne` | `sone` | ǒ → o |
| `cæsar` | `caesar` | æ → ae |
| `œnologie` | `oenologie` | œ → oe |
| `bo` + U+0308 + `ses` | `boeses` | Step 0: decomposed ö is composed before step 3 (#224) |
| `Mu` + U+0308 + `hldorf` | `muehldorf` | same with ü, plus an uppercase letter |
| `bo` + U+0306 + `ses` | `boeses` | The reported case: breve, step 0 composes to ŏ, step 3 resolves it (#224) |
| `bŏses` | `boeses` | same, already precomposed |
| `wŭnschet` | `wuenschet` | ŭ → ue |
| `few` + U+0306 + `er` | `fewer` | Breve on `w` is stripped, not expanded (ADR-017); resolves to `lemma_7108` (`viur`) |
| `wenn` + U+0306 | `wenn` | same on `n`; resolves to `lemma_7385` (`wan`) |
| `Ew` + U+0306 + `er` | `ewer` | same with an uppercase letter, so step 1 has to run first |
| `''` | `''` | Empty string |
| `None`/`null` | `''` | Null handling |

### Common Pitfall

`schône` (ô = circumflex) → `schone`, NOT `schoene`. The circumflex ô maps to plain `o`, while the umlaut ö maps to `oe`. Visually similar, semantically different.

### Step 0: Unicode composition (#224)

An „ö" can be encoded as a single character (U+00F6) or as `o` plus a combining diaeresis (U+006F U+0308). The two look identical, but only the composed form hits the umlaut rule in step 3. Without the composition a decomposed input falls through stage 1 **and** stage 2 of lemma resolution (§C) and ends up in the partial-match fallback. Bug report #224 is exactly this case, only with a different diacritic: the reported input carried `o` plus a combining **breve** (U+0306), copied out of the WZB reading view. Step 0 composes that to `ŏ`, and only the breve rule in step 3 turns it into `oe`. The two steps together are the fix, neither alone.

Decomposed forms arise when copying from macOS sources and from some edition databases, so they are ordinary user input.

**Breve instead of diaeresis (WZB, #224).** The Wenzelsbibel writes umlauts with a breve: the corpus token `bo` + U+0306 + `ses` carries a `lemmaRef` to `lemma_788` (`bœse`), `scho` + U+0306 + `ne` to `lemma_5280` (`schœne`), and `wŭnschet` is `wünschet`. Attested on 469 lemmatized WZB tokens. Hence `ŏ` → `oe` and `ŭ` → `ue` in step 3.

**Breve as a writing convention on `w` and `n` (ADR-017).** On `w` (91 tokens) and `n` (22) the breve is not an umlaut sign but a Bohemian writing convention: `few̆er` stands for `viur`, `ew̆er` for `ir`, `wenn̆` for `wan`. It is therefore **stripped**, not expanded to a digraph. Julia Hintersteiner settled that as the WZB editor on 2026-08-06; until then it was open (#224) and the two rules did not exist. Since `w` + U+0306 and `n` + U+0306 have no precomposed form, step 0 leaves them standing, which is why only 11 of the 113 tokens were findable by typing the form, all eleven through the stage-3 fallback and not one of them lemmatized. With the rules 100 are findable (93 through stage 2, 7 through stage 3), and for all four already lemmatized forms the resolution hits exactly the lemma the token itself carries. Measuring rule and the remaining 13 misses: [ADR-017](DECISIONS.md#adr-017-the-breve-over-w-and-n-is-stripped-not-expanded).

Breves on the remaining base characters stay untouched: 23 further WZB tokens (y 5, a 5, v 4, r 2, m 2, i 2, e 2, z 1). The reason is not a missing precomposed form (for `a`, `e` and `i` one exists, U+0103, U+0115, U+012D, and step 0 produces it) but that there are too few attestations and none of them lemmatized to derive a rule from: `hălses`, `nămen`, `geslăgen`, `schĕpfen`, `erschĭnen`.

**Effect on the build side:** the step changes the output in exactly three places, because the authority files are otherwise NFC. Affected are the records with a decomposed ü in `persons.xml` and `works.xml`:

| Record | before | after |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `person_1052` Hugo von Mühldorf | `hugo von mühldorf` | `hugo von muehldorf` |
| `person_1332` Wachsmut von Mühlhausen | `wachsmut von mühlhausen` | `wachsmut von muehlhausen` |
| `work_435` Lyrik von Hugo von Mühldorf | `lyrik von hugo von mühldorf` | `lyrik von hugo von muehldorf` |

All three were unfindable through normalized search. All 43,879 lemma normalizations and all 234,244 variant mappings remain unchanged. Hence Authority Index v1.6.2. **234,244 is the state of v1.6.2, not today's** (today 233,978, see §C): with the HUG stanza numerals, #138 also removed the type `type_195524` „cxlvix", attested only there, measured against the blob before `87b6dc941`. The difference of one is therefore a real data step and not a typo in either line (#277).

**Not affected:** the corpus index stores lemma ids and positions, not normalized text forms; `build-corpus-index.py` does import `normalize_mhg` but never calls it. For the corpus text itself the checkable statement is sharper than the sample originally noted here: **there is not a single combining diaeresis and no combining tilde inside `<w>` anywhere in the corpus.** The 1,339 diaereses in 566 of the 667 files all sit outside the annotated tokens, mostly in the `<note>` bibliography prose of the teiHeader (places of publication such as Tübingen, Zürich). Inside `<w>` there are 774 combining marks in total, of which 752 are WZB breves and 22 are exotics: 11 dot below, 8 macron, 3 U+035B (the abbreviation zigzag in `cetera͛`, `her͛re`).

**How these numbers are measured** (#318, without it they cannot be rechecked). All figures about **combining** marks (1,339 diaereses, 774 marks inside `<w>`, 752 breves, 22 exotics) are counted on the raw text, without prior Unicode normalization. Exactly **one** number in §A follows a different rule: the **469 lemmatized breve tokens** in the paragraph "Breve instead of diaeresis" above are counted **after NFD**, so precomposed `ŏ`/`ŭ` are included, because that is the set steps 0 and 3 handle together. The same holds for the derived split of 405 across o/u, which lives in [DECISIONS.md, ADR-016](DECISIONS.md) and not here. Measure without NFD and you get 467 and 403 and take the figure for stale; that is exactly what happened in the health check of 2026-07-31. The numbers **136** (breve on other base characters) and **64** (of those, lemmatized) are independent of normalization, identical with and without NFD. Recheck them with the same counting code once per variant.

**No gain, but the same bucket:** inside `<w>` there are eight combining macrons (u 3, p 2, d 1, i 1, n 1). Step 0 composes four of them, the three `u` to `ū` and the `i` to `ī`; step 2 resolves both. For `d`, `n` and `p` there is no precomposed form. **They do not become findable through that either: none of the eight tokens carries a `@lemmaRef`** (`flūte`, `Dorūmbe`, `cap̄`, `vn̄`). They belong in the same backfill bucket as the 289 candidates below, not in a gain column.

**Touched, but not followed up in this PR:** the WZB ingest scripts (`scripts/ingest/wzb/wzb-auto-match.py`, `-sense-assign.py`, `-sense-apply.py`) normalize through the same function. 289 WZB `<w>` with an o/u breve still carry no `@lemmaRef`, because the breve stopped the matcher; a re-run will resolve some of them. See ADR-016.

### Helper Functions

The comparison helpers exist only on the JS side (`TextNormalizer.matchesNormalized` / `.exactMatchNormalized` / `.startsWithNormalized`). The Python counterparts were removed because no build script ever called them (audit #107): Python code compares directly via `normalize_mhg(a) == normalize_mhg(b)` and so on. The hard parity contract applies to `normalize_mhg()` ↔ `TextNormalizer.normalizeMHG()`; anyone introducing a new Python comparison helper has to mirror the JS semantics 1:1 again (substring/exact/prefix over normalized strings).

**`foldDiacritics` / `matchesFolded` are deliberately outside this contract** (#419). They live in the same file and look like siblings of the functions above, but they are the opposite operation and they have, and must keep, no Python counterpart.

`normalizeMHG` **expands** a diacritic into a digraph (`ä` → `ae`), so that a user who types `baeume` reaches `Bäume`. `foldDiacritics` **collapses** it onto the base letter (`ä` → `a`), so that a user who types `baum` reaches `Bäume`. It ends with a generic decomposition pass, so accents outside the German set fall away too (`malmariee` reaches the genre `Malmariée-Lied`); the explicit rules before it stay, because a digraph or a chosen base letter is not something decomposition can decide. German umlaut alternation puts the umlaut in the inflected form (Baum/Bäume, Wald/Wälder, groß/größer) while the search box gets the stem, and under the expansion the stem is not even a prefix of the target. Both directions are needed and neither replaces the other.

**Where the fold may be used:** the modern German and English descriptors of the authority files. Four call sites today, and `grep -rn "matchesFolded\|foldDiacritics" playground/js assets/js` is the way to check the list is still complete: `SearchPatterns.multiFieldNormalized` (the concept, genre, name and work explorers), `resolveQuery` in `concept-distribution.js`, `findAlternativeMatch` in `concept-explorer.js`, and `personNameMatches` in `person-explorer.js` (which the person explorer's own `findAlternativeMatch` uses as well). The last two are the ones that are easy to forget, and both were forgotten once. `concept-explorer.js` decides the "auch: ..." hint rather than the hit list, so a folded hit was listed with no explanation of why it matched. `person-explorer.js` does not go through `multiFieldNormalized` at all, while the work explorer does and compares `work.author`: the same 27 author names with an umlaut stand character-for-character in both sets, so `kurenberg` found the works and not the person next to them. **Where it may not:** anything that compares Middle High German attestations. `normalizeMHG` is the contract there, it is parity-tested against Python, and a fold applied to corpus forms would silently widen matches that §C's three-stage lemma resolution deliberately keeps narrow.

Measured on 2026-09-11 over all five authority sets these call sites touch (567 concepts, 615 genres, 90 names, 584 works, 211 persons). **477 entries carry ä/ö/ü**, counted over exactly the fields the call sites compare and no others: concepts `termDE`/`termEN`/`altDE`/`altEN` (175), genres `termDE`/`termEN` (98), names `termDE`/`termEN` (23), works `title`/`author`/`sigle` (150), persons `preferredName`/`altNames` (31). Capitals count, because the fold lowercases first (Ämter, Ölproduktion and 10 more). Two traps this number has already fallen into, both worth repeating before anyone recounts it: over `termDE`/`termEN`/`title` alone it is 391, and a probe that reads the field names off `items[0]` never sees the alternative terms at all, because the first concept has none. Genres carry 250 `altDE` that no caller reads, so they are correctly outside the count.

Result: **exactly two pairs become equal under the fold that differ under `normalizeMHG`**: `Vogel` / `Vögel` within `concept_14020000`, and `Gottfried von Strassburg` / `Gottfried von Straßburg` within `person_8`. Each pair sits inside a single entry, so no entry becomes indistinguishable from another.

Three queries do change which concept `resolveQuery` returns, out of 5,361 derived from the descriptors themselves: `mann` and `manner` move from `Sitten/Gebräuche` (via termEN `Manners/Customs`) to `Männer/Oberbekleidung`, and `mängel` from `Eigenschaften der stimmlichen Äußerung` to `Mangel/Bedürfnis/Misserfolg`. That is the rule working as written rather than a defect, a folded prefix hit scoring the same as a raw one, and in all three the new target is the better answer. The number is here so that a fourth one, should it appear, is visible as a change. `baum` goes from 0 to 4 concepts.

## B. Position Counting Contract

**Contract:** Python build scripts and JavaScript TEI renderer MUST assign identical word positions to each `<w>` element.

**Why:** The corpus index stores lemma positions as integers (e.g., lemma_879 appears at positions [0, 15, 42]). The reading view uses these positions to navigate between hits (scroll to next/previous occurrence) and to align a clicked search result with the right word during DOM traversal. If Python counts position 42 differently than JavaScript, navigation jumps to the wrong word and proximity search (`|pos_a - pos_b| <= maxDistance`) breaks. (The highlight *decision* itself is by exact `@lemmaRef` id, not by position – see Contract B.1.)

**Parity test:** `testing/tests/position-parity.spec.js` (#131) – runs a prose text (PL1), a verse text (OVG) and a synthetic empty-`<w>` fixture through both counting paths and asserts identical position sequences.

### Rules

1. **Only count `<w>` elements with a non-empty `@lemmaRef` attribute**
2. `<w>` elements without `@lemmaRef` are **skipped** (not counted, not stored). So is `lemmaRef=""`: the XPath `[@lemmaRef]` matches it, but all three counting paths test the attribute *value*, not its presence (`build-corpus-index.py` `if not lemma_ref`, `tei-text-reader.js` `hasLemmaRef`, `ui-helpers.js` `!w.getAttribute('lemmaRef')`, #184). Corpus today: **0** such elements
3. All other elements (`<pb>`, `<lb>`, `<seg>`, `<hi>`, text nodes, etc.) are **ignored** for counting
4. Counting starts at **0** for each document
5. Order = **document order** (depth-first traversal of `<body>`)
6. `<w>` elements **with** `@lemmaRef` but **empty text content** are **skipped** (Python `if not text_content: continue`, JS `hasText` guard; identical on both sides since #131, pinned by `position-parity.spec.js`). Today the corpus contains **0** such elements, so the rule is a no-op on real data and a guard against future ingests with placeholder tokens

**There is no second counting path any more.** Until #314 there was an exception here: the XML fallback of the proximity search for uploaded files (`findCooccurringLemmas`) counted every `<w>`, including those without `@lemmaRef`, so a `maxDistance` of 10 meant "10 tokens" there instead of "10 lemmatized tokens". That path had been unreachable since the playground redesign (the upload UI had dropped out of the HTML, the entry function had no caller left) and is removed. Every position in the playground now follows the six rules above without exception.

**How large the difference would have been still matters as a measure**, because it describes the reference size of every normalized display (§H.5, item 0): across all 667 corpus files, 1,898,312 of 9,431,294 `<w>` carry no `@lemmaRef`, that is 20.13 % (peaks AUP 41.6 %, REF 39.3 %, DL1 38.8 %; 145 files carry `@lemmaRef` throughout). Recalculate with `scripts/audit/quantify-unannotated-tokens.py` (as of 2026-07-31). The cross-check against §H.2a works out: 9,431,294 minus 1,898,312 gives exactly the 7,532,982 annotated tokens named there, and not a single `<w>` in the corpus has empty text, so the non-empty guard from rule 6 subtracts nothing.

### Python (build-time)

Source: `scripts/build-corpus-index.py` (`extract_word_data`)

The selector below is the *logical* counting rule, not the literal implementation. The build does a single-pass `etree.iterwalk(body, events=('start','end'), tag=(w, l))` – chosen over a separate XPath / `.iter()` to avoid lxml proxy-id instability and to capture `<l>` boundaries (`lineStarts`/`lineEnds`, #47.3) in the same traversal.

```
Logical selection: //tei:body//tei:w[@lemmaRef]   (document order)

For each <w lemmaRef="..."> in document order:
    text_content = ''.join(el.itertext()).strip()
    if not text_content: continue           → empty <w lemmaRef> is NOT counted (JS matches this since #131)
    # @lemmaRef may carry SEVERAL whitespace-separated references (§B.1),
    # e.g. "lexicon.xml#lemma_308 lexicon.xml#lemma_5" (#170):
    lemma_ids = [frag.split('#')[1] for frag in lemmaRef.split()]
    position = len(words)                   → sequential from 0; ONE slot per token
    words.append(lemma_ids[0])              → words[] keeps the FIRST id only
    for lemma_id in dedupe(lemma_ids):
        lemmata[lemma_id].append(position)  → lemmata{} lists the position under EVERY id
```

**Consumer rule (follows from the words[]/lemmata{} split):** code answering "is position P an occurrence of lemma X?" MUST consult `lemmata[X]` (multi-ref-aware), never `words[P] === X` (first-id only). Applied in `verse-position-search.js` and `rhyme-dictionary.js` (target side); `cooccurrence-ranking.js`'s neighbor counting deliberately stays first-id (a full reverse map is not justified at 0 multi-ref corpus cases today).

### JavaScript (runtime)

Source: `extractAndFormatBody()` / `processWord()` in `assets/js/rendering/tei-text-reader.js`

```
Recursive DOM traversal of <body> children:
    state = { wordPosition: 0 }

    For each element encountered:
        if tagName === 'w':
            hasLemmaRef = el.getAttribute('lemmaRef')
            hasText     = el.textContent.trim().length > 0
            processWord(el, ...)  // render + check highlight
            if (hasLemmaRef && hasText):
                state.wordPosition++   // increment only when lemmaRef AND non-empty text (parity with Python)
```

### Parity note – empty `<w lemmaRef>` (resolved #131)

Both sides now **skip** `<w lemmaRef>` with empty text content: Python via `if not text_content: continue`, JS via the `hasText` guard in `extractAndFormatBody` (`tei-text-reader.js`, `case 'w'`). Before #131 the JS runtime incremented `wordPosition` for **every** `<w lemmaRef>` regardless of text – a latent parity gap (harmless then: **0** empty `<w lemmaRef>` across all 667 files, so the fix was a no-op on real data) that a future ingest with placeholder/gap tokens would have silently broken. The empty-`<w>` case is now pinned by `testing/tests/position-parity.spec.js`. (Because the corpus has no empty `<w lemmaRef>`, the shipped index is unchanged – no rebuild or version bump needed.)

### Parity note – note children, multi-`@lemmaRef`, proximity context (resolved #170)

Three further latent drifts of the same class ("0 corpus cases today, armed by the next ingest"), all fixed behavior-neutrally (byte-identical index rebuild):

1. **`<w>` inside date/year `<note>`:** the reader's badge branch swallowed `children()`, so a future lemmatized `<w>` inside such a note would be counted by Python/KWIC but not rendered/counted by the reader – every position after it would shift. The badge now renders **plus** its children.
2. **Whitespace-separated multi-`@lemmaRef`:** `split('#')[1]` on the whole attribute produced the broken key `"lemma_308 lexicon.xml"`. Now resolved per fragment (see pseudocode above): `words[]` keeps the first id, `lemmata{}` lists the position under every id.
3. **Proximity-context enrichment (`playground/js/ui/core/ui-helpers.js`, `enrichFileResults`):** the fourth counting path mapped index positions back onto DOM words without the empty-`<w>` guard from #131 – one empty `<w lemmaRef/>` would shift every context window behind it. Now guarded identically.

All three (plus the consumer rule above) are pinned by `testing/tests/position-parity.spec.js` with the fixture `position-parity-170.tei.xml`.

### Parity note – multi-word lemma units (#425)

**A lemma can span several consecutive `<w>`.** All of them carry the same `@lemmaRef` and the same `@ana`, each keeps its own `@pos` and its own `@corresp`. From `tei/ER.tei.xml`:

```xml
<w xml:id="ER_800200_1" lemmaRef="…#lemma_3141" pos="NAM" ana="…#lemma_3141_sense_4974" corresp="…#type_30845">joie</w>
<w xml:id="ER_800200_2" lemmaRef="…#lemma_3141" pos="PRP" ana="…#lemma_3141_sense_4974" corresp="…#type_10786">de</w>
<w xml:id="ER_800200_3" lemmaRef="…#lemma_3141" pos="ART" ana="…#lemma_3141_sense_4974" corresp="…#type_30862">la</w>
<w xml:id="ER_800200_4" lemmaRef="…#lemma_3141" pos="NAM" ana="…#lemma_3141_sense_4974" corresp="…#type_371959">curt</w>
```

`lemma_3141` is *Joie de la Court*. The same holds for `lemma_9250` *Schastel Marveile*, `lemma_9251` *Lît Marveile*, `lemma_20598` *Dolorose Garte* and, since #363, `lemma_49714` *hûsenblâter*, which is a common noun and not a name.

**Consequence for the six rules above: none.** They count `<w>`, and each of these is a `<w>`. Nothing special happens at build or render time.

**Consequence for anyone reading a lemma's token count: the token count is not the number of mentions.** Measured on 2026-09-10 for `lemma_9250`:

```
places with 2 tokens   14
places with 1 token     2   (LGR schahtelmarveil, RVBR schahtelmarveile)
tokens in total        30   for 16 mentions
```

So a frequency list, a keyness value or a lemma distribution overstates these lemmata by up to a factor of two. That is not a defect of the counting: the contract counts tokens, and there really are 30 of them. It is a defect of any reading that equates the two.

**How to find them.** A compound lemma (an `<etym type="morphological">` with at least two `<seg type="component">`) whose attested form equals one of its components exactly. Measured over `variants.xml` on 2026-09-10: of **67,913** attested forms at compound lemmata, **8** are a bare component. Six of those eight rows belong to the four proper names among the five listed above, `lemma_3141` contributing three of them (*joie*, *de*, *la*); the other two, `lemma_119` *ein* and `lemma_51511` *wegen*, are not multi-word units. It is a candidate list to be read, not a finder, and it is a lower bound twice over: a unit without a morphological decomposition in `lexicon.xml` does not show up, and neither does one whose attested spelling has drifted away from the component form, which in a Middle High German corpus is the normal case. `lemma_49714` is the proof of the second hole: its components are *hûse* and *blâtere*, its attested forms are *hausen*, *hawsen*, *blater*, *pleter* and so on, and not one of them is string-equal to a component, so this search does not find it at all. The reliable way is the one #363 took: search the corpus for the spelling, not the lexicon for the component. (After #363 the same measurement reads 67,927 forms and the same 8 rows.)

(This paragraph said **16** from #425 until 2026-09-10. The figure was not reproducible under any reading of its own criterion; 67,913 was and is correct.)

The same lemma can carry both spellings, and one text can carry both by itself: `lemma_9250` appears as two tokens in `CRO`, `JT`, `MNB`, `PZ` and `RVBR` and as one token in `LGR` and `RVBR`. `lemma_49714` likewise appears as two tokens thirteen times, in eleven recipes, and as one token in six. Nor are the tokens of a unit necessarily siblings: `RVBR_8923_1` stands inside a `<hi>`, `RVBR_8923_2` does not, so "consecutive" means document order and an XPath on `l/w` misses the pair.

**Why this note exists.** In #363 a session claimed twice on one day that a multi-word unit would be "the first in the corpus" and argued against the philologically correct assignment on that basis. Both times a look at `variants.xml` would have settled it. The practice is years old and was documented nowhere.

### Example

```xml
<body>
  <p>
    <w lemmaRef="lexicon.xml#lemma_100">Der</w>        <!-- position 0 -->
    <w>unbekannt</w>                                     <!-- SKIPPED (no lemmaRef) -->
    <w lemmaRef="lexicon.xml#lemma_879">brôt</w>        <!-- position 1 -->
    <pc join="left">,</pc>                                <!-- not a <w>, ignored -->
    <w lemmaRef="lexicon.xml#lemma_200">ist</w>         <!-- position 2 -->
  </p>
</body>
```

Corpus index stores: `lemmata: { "lemma_879": [1] }` – position 1, not 2.

### Version History

- **v3.x:** Paragraph-based indexing (positions reset per `<p>` – caused misalignment between Python XPath extraction and JavaScript DOM traversal)
- **v4.0.0:** Document-level indexing (positions never reset – simple, reliable)

## B.1 Lemma Highlight Matching Contract

**Contract:** A `<w>` is highlighted iff its `@lemmaRef` contains the searched lemma id as an **exact whitespace-separated token** – never as a substring.

**Why:** `@lemmaRef` may carry several space-separated values (e.g. `lexicon.xml#lemma_308 lexicon.xml#lemma_5`). A substring test (`lemmaRef.includes('#lemma_308')`) also matches neighboring ids like `#lemma_3089` (jâmer), `#lemma_3087`, `#lemma_30800` – so a search for one lemma highlights unrelated words and inflates the in-reader hit counter. This was bug #126 (fix `8e38f25cc`).

### Rule

Single source: `lemmaRefMatchesId(lemmaRef, lemmaId)` in `assets/js/lib/lemma-match.js` (shared by main site and playground, like `text-normalizer.js`).

```
function lemmaRefMatchesId(lemmaRef, lemmaId):
    if not lemmaRef or not lemmaId: return false
    refIds = lemmaRef.split(/\s+/).map(t => t.split('#')[1]).filter(Boolean)
    return refIds.includes(lemmaId)        // exact — NOT lemmaRef.includes('#' + id)
```

### Test cases

| `@lemmaRef` | search id | match? |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `lexicon.xml#lemma_308` | `lemma_308` | yes |
| `lexicon.xml#lemma_3089` | `lemma_308` | **no** (substring trap) |
| `lexicon.xml#lemma_308 lexicon.xml#lemma_5` | `lemma_5` | yes |
| `lexicon.xml#lemma_30800` | `lemma_308` | **no** |

**Applies to all highlight/match paths**, all routed through the single `lemmaRefMatchesId` since #130 (was 6 inline copies across 4 files, the duplication that made #126 possible). Call sites today, measured 2026-08-01: `tei-text-reader.js:770/:784` (single + multi-lemma), `kwic-service.js:93` (KWIC lines) and `ui-helpers.js:444` in the playground (context highlight).

Two former call sites are gone, and both are worth naming because the rule is easy to think of as universal: `text-renderer.js` lost its dead render path and then the whole shim (audit #42 plus Carearbeit 2026-07), and `tei-manager.js` stopped calling it with #314. The latter is not a gap: the proximity search reads `words[]` from the corpus index, and that array holds exactly one lemma ID per position (`build-corpus-index.py`: `words.append(lemma_ids[0])`, #170). There is no whitespace-separated list to tokenize, so a normalized `===` is the same predicate there. The unused import stayed behind until #325.

Validated on real corpus data: PL1 689 → 57, OVG 369 → 26 (matches the result-card count).

### Test Coverage

`testing/tests/lemma-matching.spec.js` (#130). Block 1 asserts the §B.1 case table against the real `lemmaRefMatchesId`; Block 2 is an e2e reader assertion (`korpus.html?textId=PL1&lemmaIds=lemma_308` → exactly 57 `.highlight`, OVG → 26). Verified to fail red against the pre-#126 substring logic.

## C. 3-Stage Lemma Resolution Algorithm

**Contract:** Search resolves user input to lemma IDs through exactly 3 stages, in order, with early return. One caller may skip all three: a component that already holds an exact lemma id can pin it (§C.1.1). That path exists in one place and nowhere else.

**Why:** MHG has extensive orthographic variation. A single lemma can appear as dozens of attested forms. The 3-stage approach balances precision (exact first) with recall (fuzzy last).

Source: `assets/js/search/search-engine.js` (`resolveLemmaIds`), `playground/js/data/authority-manager.js` (`searchLemmaByOrthography`). Since #224 the stage-3 predicate and its ranking distance live together in `assets/js/lib/lemma-resolve.js`; both interfaces import them. Only stage 3 is explicitly shared: stage 1 still differs (the main site compares against the index's precomputed `lemma.normalized`, the playground normalizes at runtime and additionally ranks homographs by corpus frequency). Since #224 the playground applies the frequency tie-break in **stage 3** as well, after the length distance and before index order (`authority-manager.js`, `searchLemmaByOrthography`). The pseudocode below reflects the main-site ordering; anyone who needs the playground order should read the lesson from #163/#164 along with it: at equal distance the more frequent lemma wins, because consumers of `matches[0]` silently take the first hit.

### Pseudocode

```
function resolveLemmaIds(normalized):
    // Input: already normalized via normalizeMHG() (Contract A)
    // Called by searchLemma() which normalizes the raw user input first

    // Stage 1: Exact match on normalized canonical form
    results = []
    for each lemma in authorityIndex.lemmata:
        if lemma.normalized === normalized:
            results.push(lemma.id)
    if results.length > 0:
        return results                       // EARLY RETURN — skip stages 2-3

    // Stage 2: Variants dictionary lookup (O(1) hash map)
    variantMatch = authorityIndex.variants[normalized]
    if variantMatch:
        return [variantMatch]                // EARLY RETURN — skip stage 3

    // Stage 3: Partial match fallback (bidirectional PREFIX, see #224)
    results = []
    for each lemma in authorityIndex.lemmata:
        if lemma.normalized.startsWith(normalized)                  // stem input
           OR (lemma.normalized.length >= 3
               AND normalized.startsWith(lemma.normalized)):        // inflected input
            results.push(lemma)
    sort results by abs(len(lemma.normalized) - len(normalized))    // closest first
    return results.map(lemma => lemma.id)                          // May be empty
```

### Stage Behavior

| Stage | Input Type | Return | Performance | Example |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Canonical or normalized form | 0..N lemma IDs (homographs) | O(n) scan | `brot` → `[lemma_879]` |
| 2 | Attested orthographic variant | Exactly 1 lemma ID | O(1) lookup | `brott` → normalize → `brot` → variants[`brot`] → `lemma_879` |
| 3 | Prefix match, both directions | 0..N lemma IDs, closest first | O(n) scan + sort | `minnecl` → `minnec`, `minne`, `minneclîch`, …; `schwertkampf` → none |

### Stage 3: why prefix and not substring (#224)

Until July 2026 stage 3 was a bidirectional **substring** test. The direction "input contains lemma" hit every short lemma that sat anywhere inside the input. The lexicon holds 5 one-letter, 98 two-letter and 598 three-letter normalized forms; they matched practically every input that reached stage 3 at all. For `minnecl` it returned 16 hits, led by `i`, `unminneclîche` and `nec`; for `schwertkampf` 14, among them `a`, `êr`, `wert`, `kamp`.

Middle High German inflection is suffixal, so a prefix test keeps both useful cases (stem input finds the full lemma, inflected input finds the lemma) and drops the noise. The minimum length of 3 applies only in the direction "input begins with lemma"; in the other direction the lemma is longer than the input by construction.

**On how the bug report came about, because it is easily told wrong:** the search for „böses" shown there carried a **decomposed** umlaut ö (`o` + U+0308 instead of U+00F6). That is why it missed stages 1 and 2 (the variants map holds the key `boeses`, not the decomposed form) and reached stage 3 in the first place, where the substring test turned it into `ês`, `ô`, `sê`, without `bœse`. With a composed ö, stage 2 resolves the same input correctly to `bœse`. So the report had two causes, and both are fixed: the NFC composition in contract A and the prefix rule here.

Measured over 300 variant forms with a known target lemma, drawn with a fixed seed (`scripts/audit/measure-stage3-resolution.py`, stages 1 and 2 bypassed):

| Metric | old (substring) | old + new ranking | new (prefix) |
|--------|----------------:|--------------------:|-------------:|
| Recall (target anywhere in the list) | 11.3 % | 11.3 % | 10.7 % |
| Top-1 after ranking | 0.3 % | 9.3 % | 10.0 % |
| Median list size | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Largest list | 108 | 108 | 8 |

**The middle column matters:** the big jump in top-1 (0.3 % → 9.3 %) comes from the new sort by length difference, not from the new rule. The rule itself contributes 9.3 % → 10.0 %. Its actual gain is in the bottom two rows: the result list shrinks from a median of 8 to 0.

The recall loss of 2 cases out of 300 concerns prefix breakers: `gewieren` → `wieren` (prefix `ge-`) and the Roman numeral `ccccxli`. Both are attested variants in real use and are already resolved by stage 2; the measurement bypasses stage 2 on purpose. A median of 0 means: for a random unknown form, stage 3 now usually returns nothing instead of eight false hits. That is intended, the interface then shows its no-hit state.

**Bias of the measurement:** real stage-3 inputs are more often New High German words and typos than Middle High German inflected forms. The sample measures whether the fix costs recall, not how often stage 3 finds the right thing in everyday use.

**Side effect beyond stage 3:** `resolveLemmaIds` also supplies the reference set for the keyness column of the table view (#114, `app.js`). For search terms that reach stage 3, the log-likelihood values therefore change, because the reference sum runs over fewer lemmata.

### Worked Example

User types: **brott**

1. Normalize: `brott` → `brott` (no special MHG characters)
2. Stage 1: Scan all lemmata for `.normalized === 'brott'` → no match
3. Stage 2: Check `authorityIndex.variants['brott']` → `'lemma_879'` → **found!**
4. Return: `['lemma_879']` (Stage 3 never runs)

### Variant Dictionary Structure

- Flat map: `{ normalized_variant_form: lemma_id }`
- 233,978 normalized entries (as of 2026-09-24; 256,512 raw forms in variants.xml, deduped first-occurrence-wins), extracted from `authority-files/variants.xml`
- **Two numbers that have to stay different:** 256,512 is the count of raw forms in `variants.xml`, 233,978 the count of mappings in the runtime dictionary after deduplication. Whoever writes "variants dictionary" means the smaller one. Whoever reads 234,244 is reading the state before #138 (§A, step 0)
- **First occurrence wins** – if two lemmata claim the same variant form, only the first one stored (source: `parse_variants()` in `build-authority-index.py`, the `if normalized_variant not in variants` guard). Line anchors drift; look the function up by name
- **This rule is decided away and not yet built.** [ADR-021](DECISIONS.md#adr-021-an-ambiguous-written-form-returns-every-candidate-lemma-ranked-by-that-forms-own-frequency) (KZW, 2026-09-14, #378) replaces „exactly 1" with „0..N, ranked by how often *this* normalized form occurs under each candidate". Nothing in the code has changed, so the stage table above still describes what runs today; whoever implements the ADR renarrates the stage 2 row and the return shape in both consumers
- Keys are **normalized** forms (lowercase + MHG character mapping applied before storage)

### C.1.1 Pinned resolution: a caller that already holds the id (#58)

The three stages start from a written form. A caller coming from the lemma
explorer has no written form to interpret, it has a lemma the user clicked.
Handing over the label alone would send that click back through stage 1, where a
homograph group returns `matches[0]`, which can be a different lemma than the one
on screen.

Measured on 2026-09-24 against `authority-files/lexicon.xml` (43,713 entries with a
`form/orth`): 102 written forms carry more than one entry (216 lemmata), and after
normalization 476 forms do (991 lemmata, 2.27 percent). `sin`, `wal`, `mal` and `de`
are in that set. Counting rule, because the number depends on it: group by
`normalize_mhg()` from `scripts/mhg_normalizer.py`, the canonical normalizer, not by a
hand-written character map. On the first measurement (2026-08-07, 43,879 entries,
477/993) a shorter map yielded 475/988, and that is how the wrong pair got into the
first draft of this section. The step from 477/993 to 476/991 is #228: it deleted
`lemma_64413`, and the group `erklaeren` is left with `lemma_14608` alone.

The `ids` parameter of the `multi-lemma` route therefore pins the resolution.
`MultiLemmaSearchUI.lemmaIdHints` maps written form to id, and `resolveTerms()`
consults it before falling through to `resolveLemmaIds()`. Four properties keep
this from becoming a second resolution path:

- **Only the router fills the map.** `addLemmaFromInput()` deletes any pin under
  the same label, so a hand-typed term is always a written form and nothing else.
- **Position is the whole contract, with one limit.** `lemmata` and `ids` are paired
  by index before empty terms are dropped, so `lemmata=a,,b&ids=1,2,3` does not shift
  `2` onto `b`. Empty and non-numeric entries, and terms without a counterpart, fall
  back to the three stages. The limit: the map is keyed by written form, so two
  identical labels with different ids (`lemmata=arm,arm&ids=285,286`) collapse onto the
  last one. No producer emits that, and the chip list would show the same word twice;
  pinning both members of a homograph group in one query needs a different carrier.
- **The error path uses the same predicate.** The "no lemma found" diagnosis calls
  `resolveTerms()` too, otherwise it would report a term as unresolvable whose id
  is fixed.
- **The pins are copied before the modal closes.** `executeSearch()` snapshots
  them next to `searchTerms`, because `close()` runs `reset()`, which clears the
  map. Reading `this.lemmaIdHints` at resolution time would always find it empty:
  the pin would be silently ignored and every hand-over would fall back to the
  written form, which is exactly the bug the parameter exists to prevent.

**The copy-before-close rule is older than the pin and covers every piece of modal
state `executeSearch()` still needs after `close()`.** As of 2026-08-07 that is four:
`searchMode`, `searchTerms`, `zeiger` and `distanz`. The last one was found by the
review of #58 and had been broken for longer: `reset()` sets `proximityDistance` back
to `'10'`, and the distance was read after `close()`. Measured before the fix, the
route calls with `dist=3`, `dist=10` and `dist=25` all produced the same header
("max. 10 Wörter") and the same hits, so the `dist` parameter and the "Belege" link of
the co-occurrence ranking (which passes the selected window and names it in its
tooltip) were both inert. Whoever adds a fifth piece of state to this modal copies it
in the same place; the test that guards this uses a distance other than 10, because
`dist=10` is green either way.

Stages 1 to 3 are untouched (ADR-016 stands); this sits in front of them. Two
other producers of `#multi-lemma&lemmata=...` do **not** pin yet and still resolve
by written form: `cooccurrence-ranking.js` (the "Belege" link) and
`sendWordComponentSelection()` in the lemma explorer. Any claim that the hand-over
is id-exact holds for the explorer button only.

## C.2 Multi-Lemma Deduplication

**Contract:** When a search resolves to multiple lemma IDs, results MUST be deduplicated by text and match counts aggregated before display. Two separate dedup algorithms exist for two different contexts.

**Why:** A single user search can resolve to multiple lemmata (e.g., homographs, or variant → multiple canonical forms). Without dedup, the same text appears multiple times in results – confusing and inflating counts.

### C.2.1 Main Site: Dedup by textId

Source: inline dedup in `handleSearch()`, `assets/js/app.js` (lemmaSet/textMap aggregation; no standalone function)

**Trigger:** User searches on `korpus.html`. `SearchEngine.searchLemma()` returns one result per (textId, lemmaId) pair. When N lemmata match, the same text can appear N times.

```
// inline in handleSearch() — pseudocode:
dedup(rawResults):
    // rawResults = [{textId, lemmaId, matchCount, ...}, ...]
    // Multiple entries per textId when search resolved to >1 lemmaId

    lemmaSet = new Set()       // unique lemmata found
    textMap = new Map()        // textId → aggregated result

    for each result in rawResults:
        lemmaSet.add(result.lemmaId)

        if textMap.has(result.textId):
            existing = textMap.get(result.textId)
            existing.matchCount += result.matchCount    // SUM counts
            existing.lemmaIds.push(result.lemmaId)      // COLLECT all matching lemmata
        else:
            textMap.set(result.textId, {
                ...result,
                lemmaIds: [result.lemmaId]              // start list
            })

    return Array.from(textMap.values())
    // Each text appears ONCE with total matchCount and all lemmaIds
```

**Worked example** – user searches "brot":

1. Resolution: Stage 1 finds `lemma_879` ("brôt") AND `lemma_12345` ("brot", different entry)
2. `SearchEngine.searchLemma()` returns:
   - `{textId: "ABG", lemmaId: "lemma_879", matchCount: 3}`
   - `{textId: "ABG", lemmaId: "lemma_12345", matchCount: 1}`
   - `{textId: "DES2", lemmaId: "lemma_879", matchCount: 5}`
3. After dedup:
   - `{textId: "ABG", matchCount: 4, lemmaIds: ["lemma_879", "lemma_12345"]}`
   - `{textId: "DES2", matchCount: 5, lemmaIds: ["lemma_879"]}`
4. Both lemmata get distinct highlight colors in reading view

### C.2.2 Playground: Proximity Window Selection and Context Dedup

Source: `playground/js/data/tei-manager.js` (`findCoveringWindow`, `searchProximityUsingEnhancedIndex`)

Two steps that both changed with #169 (KZW decision 2026-07-28). Numbers from before 2026-07-29 are not comparable for searches with three or more lemmata; see the JOURNAL entry of that date.

**Caveat on the input positions.** This function builds its per-lemma position lists by scanning `words[]` for equality, so it is first-id only and does not follow the §B.1 consumer rule (the verse search next to it does, via `lemmata{}`). Same standing justification as `cooccurrence-ranking.js`: 0 multi-ref cases in the corpus today. It becomes wrong the moment a `<w>` carries two `@lemmaRef` ids.

**Step 1 – window selection.** `maxDistance` bounds the SPAN of all matched positions, not each position's distance to the anchor lemma. A hit requires one window of width `maxDistance` that holds the anchor and one occurrence of every other lemma.

`maxDistance` is clamped to the range the UI declares (`0…50`, from `input#proximityDistance[max=50]`) before the search runs, with a non-numeric value falling back to 10. The hash route only validates `dist > 0`, and unlike the old anchor test the window search gets more expensive as the distance grows, so the data layer enforces the bound itself rather than trusting the surface.

**Precondition on the lemma list (same reasoning, one level over).** Both enhanced paths, `searchProximityUsingEnhancedIndex` and `searchVerseUsingEnhancedIndex`, normalise their `lemmaIds` once to bare ids (`lemma_7532` and `7532` are the same lemma), deduplicate them, and continue with that list. **With fewer than two remaining ids they return `[]` before searching.** Without this, a search degenerates silently: `findCoveringWindow` has no list left to cover and returns an empty array, which is truthy, and the caller only tests `chosen === null`, so every occurrence of the single lemma would be reported as a hit with distance 0. The verse path degenerates the same way for a different reason: its comparison loop starts at `i = 1` and never runs, leaving `allInVerse` true. Duplicates reach this point in practice because different inputs resolve to the same lemma (`wîn` via stage 1, `wein` via the variants list). The pseudocode below therefore describes a case, the empty `otherPositionLists`, that the enhanced paths can no longer produce; it is kept because `findCoveringWindow` is also tested directly.

```
function findCoveringWindow(firstPos, otherPositionLists, maxDistance):
    // otherPositionLists = ascending position arrays, one per non-anchor lemma
    if otherPositionLists is empty: return []

    // An optimal window always starts on an occupied position
    candidates = {firstPos}
    for each list in otherPositionLists:
        candidates += every p in list with firstPos - maxDistance <= p <= firstPos

    best = null, bestSpan = INFINITY
    for each windowStart in sorted(candidates):
        windowEnd = windowStart + maxDistance
        if firstPos > windowEnd: continue

        chosen = []
        for each list in otherPositionLists:
            p = first element of list >= windowStart     // binary search
            if p does not exist OR p > windowEnd: mark uncovered, break
            chosen.push(p)
        if uncovered: continue

        span = max(firstPos, ...chosen) - min(firstPos, ...chosen)
        if span < bestSpan: bestSpan = span, best = chosen

    return best        // null when no window carries all lemmata
```

**Why the search over window starts, not just a range check.** Until 2026-07-29 each further lemma was tested against `firstPos` alone (`positions.find(p => abs(p - firstPos) <= maxDistance)`), so B at anchor−5 and C at anchor+5 both passed at `maxDistance` 5 although they sit 10 apart; `actualDistance` then reported the 10 correctly in the very same result object. Adding a span check on top of the old selection would not fix it, because `find()` returns the FIRST position in anchor range, not the most useful one. With B = {90, 110}, C = {109}, `firstPos` = 100 and `maxDistance` = 10 that selection yields B = 90, span 19, and the hit would be dropped although B = 110 with C = 109 spans exactly 10. Iterating the possible window starts also keeps the reported distance minimal.

**Step 2 – context dedup.** Overlapping context windows in the same file collapse to the one with the SHORTEST distance.

```
function deduplicateProximityResults(rawMatches):
    // rawMatches = [{filename, matchPositions, distance, contextStart, contextEnd, ...}, ...]
    byFile = groupBy(rawMatches, 'filename')
    deduplicated = []

    for each (filename, fileResults) in byFile:
        byDistance = COPY of fileResults sorted by (distance asc, contextStart asc)

        kept = []
        for each result in byDistance:
            overlaps = kept.any(existing =>
                max(existing.contextStart, result.contextStart)
                    < min(existing.contextEnd, result.contextEnd)
            )
            if NOT overlaps: kept.push(result)
            // else: discard — the kept match is the closer one by construction

        sort kept by contextStart ascending      // output follows the text
        deduplicated += kept

    return deduplicated
```

**Behavior:** the closest co-occurrence in a passage wins; output order stays reading order. Before 2026-07-29 the sort key was `contextStart`, so the EARLIEST match won while the comment and the console log claimed "keeping shorter distance" (#169 finding 48). Users were shown the more distant co-occurrence whenever the earlier window happened to be the wider one.

### C.2.3 Playground: Document-Level Aggregation

Source: `playground/js/data/tei-manager.js` (document search function)

**Trigger:** Multi-lemma document search (find texts containing ALL searched lemmata).

```
function searchDocumentLevel(lemmaIds, corpusData):
    // corpusData is window.playground.corpusData, filled by the playground's
    // own file browser. Not the main site's identically named selection.
    results = []
    includedTexts = corpusData.includedTexts or empty set

    for each text in corpusData.texts:
        // Honours the playground's text selection, unlike the analysis tools
        // in section H (see the scope note there)
        if text.id not in includedTexts: continue

        // Require ALL lemmata present (intersection, not union). Each id is
        // normalized and then tried under both spellings, because the caller
        // hands over bare ids while the index keys carry the prefix.
        containsAll = lemmaIds.every(id =>
            cleanId = id without leading "lemma_"
            text.lemmata["lemma_" + cleanId] or text.lemmata[cleanId] exists)

        if containsAll:
            // matchCount is the evidence count: the length of each lemma's
            // position list, summed over all searched lemmata (#58).
            matchCount = sum over lemmaIds of
                length(text.lemmata["lemma_" + cleanId] or text.lemmata[cleanId] or [])
            results.push({filename, title, author, context: 'document', matchCount})

    return results
    // No dedup needed — each text can only appear once (checked via containsAll)
```

**Why both spellings:** `resolveLemmaIds` strips the prefix (`tei-ui.js`, `matches[0].id.replace('lemma_', '')`), the index writes it (`build-corpus-index.py`, keys like `"lemma_879"`). A lookup on the bare id alone would find nothing, silently, for every query. The other two modes reach the same place differently and do **not** use this double lookup: the verse path normalizes upward to one prefixed key, the proximity path compares stripped ids against `words[]`. Three spellings of one rule, which is why this one is written out here.

**Note:** No dedup needed here because the intersection check (`every`) guarantees each text appears at most once.

**A field removed and a field restored (#327, then #58):** the pushed object used to carry a `matchingWords` map, the hit count per lemma, built in a loop over `lemmaIds` with two index lookups per matching text. Its last reader was `formatMatchingWordsOrCounts` in `tei-ui.js`, which had lost its own callers long before; when that method went, the field became write-only and was dropped. The card then fell back to the only number left, `totalWords`, and showed the token count of the whole text as the hit count: the same figure for every lemma in that text, and summed into the header (`arm` as an adjective, lemma_285, reported 6,418,133 across 207 texts where 820 is right). #58 restored the count as `matchCount` and removed `totalWords`, because after the change it would itself have had no reader left. That is the trap to avoid here: a write-only field on this object is what produced the bug the first time.

## D. External API Contracts

### D.1 Wikidata Image Fetch

**Trigger:** Reading view opens a text whose work has a `wikidata` field in the authority index.

Source: `assets/js/rendering/tei-text-reader.js` → `getWikidataImage()` (~line 939; P18 `wbgetclaims` request at ~line 944)

**Request chain (3 sequential calls):**

```
1. GET https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php
     ?action=wbgetclaims&property=P18&entity={wikidataId}&format=json&origin=*
   Response: { claims: { P18: [{ mainsnak: { datavalue: { value: "Filename.jpg" }}}]}}
   Extract: filename from claims.P18[0].mainsnak.datavalue.value

2. Image URL (no API call):
   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/{filename}?width=400

3. GET https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/api.php
     ?action=query&titles=File:{filename}&prop=imageinfo&iiprop=extmetadata&format=json&origin=*
   Response: { query: { pages: { "-1": { imageinfo: [{ extmetadata: {
     Artist: { value: "..." },
     LicenseShortName: { value: "CC BY-SA 3.0" }
   }}]}}}}
   Extract: Artist.value (HTML — cleaned to text), LicenseShortName.value
```

**Error handling:** All calls wrapped in try/catch. On any failure, image section stays hidden (graceful degradation).

### D.2 Wörterbuchnetz API

**Single implementation:** `assets/js/lib/woerterbuchnetz.js` (`fetchWbnetzEntries`, `decodeHtmlEntities`, `DICTIONARIES`, `DICTIONARY_TITLES`, `dictionaryTitle`) – shared by all three call sites; do NOT re-implement the fetch inline.

**Triggers:**
- Lemma page loads (`lemma/lemma-page.js`, `fetchWoerterbuchnetz`, #73)
- Korpus search renders the lemma panel (`assets/js/app.js`, `fetchWbnetzLinksInto`, #114 – up to 3 lemmata per search)
- Hapax tool expands a row's detail panel (`playground/js/ui/tei/hapax-legomena.js`, #196 – one lookup per expanded row)

```
GET https://api.woerterbuchnetz.de/open-api/dictionaries/{sigle}/lemmata/{normalizedForm}

Parallel requests for: MWB, Lexer, LexerN, BMZ, FindeB   (five since #258, 2026-07-31)
Uses: Promise.all() (each request individually try/catch-guarded,
      so one failure yields empty entries instead of rejecting)
Caching: memoized per normalizedForm for the browser session
      (repeat searches must not re-hit the external API)
Safety: entries whose wbnetzlink is not http(s) are dropped by the
      shared client; callers must still attribute-escape values
      (incl. quotes) before interpolating into href="..."
Dedup: within one dictionary, a wbnetzlink already seen is dropped —
      FindeB repeats a wbnetzid across spelling doublets and would
      otherwise render as several identical links. Deliberately NOT
      global: the same deep-link under two sigles is two articles.
Returns: [{sigle, entries, failed}] — `failed` marks the empty lists
      that mean "request did not go through" (timeout, network, 5xx)
      rather than "no such headword" (4xx). Link renderers may ignore
      it; any caller that turns an empty result into a STATEMENT about
      the evidence must not (see below).

Response: {                              // illustrative shape, IDs schematic
    result_set: [{
        sigle: "Lexer",
        lemma: "br&ocirc;t",     // HTML-encoded — decode via DOMParser (see below)
        gram: "stN",
        wbnetzid: "L02435",
        wbnetzlink: "https://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/Lexer/L02435"
    }]
}
```

**Dictionary list and order.** `DICTIONARIES` is query order and display order in one; `DICTIONARY_TITLES` resolves the sigles, which the API itself does not expose (`/dictionaries` returns sigle + path only, no titles). Rendering rule per surface: the lemma page, as the deep-dive surface, spells the title out as a heading above each dictionary group and shows every entry; the two compact surfaces (korpus lemma panel, hapax detail cell) carry the title as a `title` attribute on the sigle and cap each dictionary at three entries. The `gram` value belongs in the link text on all three: several entries of one dictionary are homographs and would otherwise render as identical adjacent links.

**Not a defect:** a dictionary returning zero entries for a well-attested word. The MWB is still being published; measured 2026-07-31 it has no entry for `minne` or `vriunt`, while `herze` and `liebe` resolve. Do not treat that as a broken endpoint and do not build a workaround.

**Absence of a link is not absence of attestation.** The hapax tool (#196) is the one consumer that reads an empty result as evidence („Kandidat für ein echtes Hapax"). It must therefore branch on `failed`: on a full outage it says the evidence is not checkable, on a partial one it names the dictionaries that did not answer. Any future consumer that draws a philological conclusion from an empty result carries the same obligation, otherwise a network fault is published as a finding.

**HTML entity decoding:** `lemma` field contains HTML entities. Decoded via the shared `decodeHtmlEntities` from `lib/woerterbuchnetz.js` – implemented with `DOMParser('text/html')` + `textContent`, NOT the textarea-`innerHTML` trick: a `</textarea><img onerror=…>` payload would create live elements during the `innerHTML` write (mXSS class), before any downstream escaping runs. DOMParser documents have no browsing context (no script execution, no resource loads).

**Datenschutz:** All three triggers send the normalized lemma form to a third party; documented in `impressum.html` → Datenschutz („Wörterbuch-Verweise"), which names the queried dictionaries and must be updated whenever `DICTIONARIES` changes.

### D.3 Static External Links (no API calls)

| Target | URL Pattern | Source |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Old MHDBDB | `https://mhdbdb-old.sbg.ac.at/mhdbdb/App?action=Dic&lid={numericId}` | `lemma-page.js:239` |
| REALonline (IMAREAL) | `https://realonline.imareal.sbg.ac.at/suche#{json}` where json = `{"s":"{normalized}"}` | `lemma-page.js:244` |
| Corpus search | `../korpus.html?search={lemma.lemma}` – evaluated in `app.js` `handleURLParameters()` (#144): fills the search field and triggers the normal search | `lemma-page.js:249` |
| GND (person/work) | `https://d-nb.info/gnd/{gndId}` | `tei-text-reader.js` |
| Wikidata (person/work) | `https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/{wikidataId}` | `tei-text-reader.js` |
| Handschriftencensus | URL stored in authority index `work.handschriftencensus` | `tei-text-reader.js` |
| Zotero | URL stored in `work.biblStructs[].corresp` | `tei-text-reader.js` |

### D.4 MWB Online Metadata API (blocked)

```
GET http://tares-neu.uni-trier.de:8080/exist/rest/db/MWB/Services/retrieve_MWB_lemma_metadata.xql?lemma={term}

Response (XML):
<entry>
  <MWB><id>...</id><lemma>...</lemma><gram>...</gram><url>https://www.mhdwb-online.de/wb/{id}</url></MWB>
  <MWV><lexer>...</lexer><bmz>...</bmz><fb>...</fb></MWV>
</entry>
```

**Status:** HTTP-only API. Blocked by mixed content when called from HTTPS page. Currently using static link only. Upgrade to dynamic lookup when MWB team migrates to HTTPS.

### D.5 Lemma Page URL Routing Contract

**Contract:** The URL `/lemma/{numericId}` MUST resolve to a rendered lemma page. This URL is stored by external systems (Worterbuchnetz, MWB, Wikidata P9351) and must remain stable indefinitely.

**Why:** External dictionary networks link to MHDBDB lemmata by numeric ID. Breaking these URLs breaks scholarly infrastructure across institutions.

Source: `404.html` (redirect), `lemma/lemma-page.js:48-72` (parsing)

```
URL routing (GitHub Pages, no server-side routing):

1. /lemma/879          → 404.html intercepts
   404.html:           → detects 'lemma' in path, extracts '879'
                       → window.location.replace('/lemma/?id=879')
   lemma/index.html:   → loads lemma-page.js
   parseLemmaId():     → reads ?id=879 → returns '879'

2. /lemma/?id=879      → direct (no redirect needed)
   parseLemmaId():     → URLSearchParams.get('id') → '879'

3. /lemma/#879         → direct (no redirect needed)
   parseLemmaId():     → window.location.hash.slice(1) → '879'

Parse order: ?id > #hash > path segment (first match wins)
```

**ID mapping:** `numericId` → `lemma_{numericId}` (internal key) = Wikidata P9351 value = Worterbuchnetz `lid`

---

## E. Cache Invalidation

### IndexedDB Databases

| Database | Library | Store | Key | Used By |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| `MHDBDBMainSite` | Dexie.js | `indices` | `name` (string) | `assets/js/lib/corpus-loader.js` |
| `MHDBDB_TEI_Cache` | Raw IndexedDB | `parsedTEI` | `filename` (string) | `assets/js/storage/tei-cache-manager.js` |

**These two databases are the only ones.** Until #314 the playground kept a third, `MHDBDB_Playground`, with a single store `tei_files` for the uploaded files. With the upload path removed it has no writer left; `playground-main.js` deletes it once at startup (`dropLegacyPlaygroundDatabase()`, a no-op on a database that does not exist). That replaces the v3 schema migration from #280, which cleared three writer-less legacy stores and, after the removal, would no longer run for lack of a manager instance. Corpus and authority data were never stored there but in the shared `CorpusLoader` (`MHDBDBMainSite`). **A second cache path must not reappear.**

The name `MHDBDB_Playground` therefore remains in the code in two places, and both are deliberate: `dropLegacyPlaygroundDatabase()` only takes effect if someone opens the playground, and `KNOWN_DB_NAMES` in `assets/js/site-chrome.js` is the second chance, via the „Site-Daten zurücksetzen" button on every page. The two may only disappear together, realistically from mid-2027 on.

### Index Cache (MHDBDBMainSite)

**Store schema:** `{ name, version, timestamp, data }`

**Version check flow** (source: `getCachedData()` in `corpus-loader.js`, the `cached.version !== expectedVersion` branch; line anchors drift, look it up by name):

```
getCachedIndex(name):
    cached = db.indices.get(name)
    if !cached → return null (cache miss)

    // Version check (konkrete Konstanten siehe corpus-loader.js; aktueller Stand TEI-MODEL.md §11)
    if name === 'corpus-index':
        if cached.version !== INDEX_VERSION:           → invalidate
    if name === 'authority-index':
        if cached.version !== AUTHORITY_INDEX_VERSION: → invalidate

    // Expiration check
    age = Date.now() - cached.timestamp
    if age > 30 days:                                            → invalidate

    return cached.data
```

**Five-place version bump (mandatory synchronicity):**

On every index schema bump five places have to be kept in sync. The first three are load-bearing: if they drift, the cache invalidation logic does not fire and production users with an old cache never see the new index. The other two are documentation and break nothing, which is exactly why they drift unnoticed (#307).

1. `scripts/build-corpus-index.py` → `'version': 'X.Y.Z'` in the final index dict
2. `scripts/build-authority-index.py` → likewise
3. `assets/js/lib/corpus-loader.js` → `INDEX_VERSION` and `AUTHORITY_INDEX_VERSION`
4. `docs/TEI-MODEL.md` §11 → the version table (`| Corpus Index | … |`, `| Authority Index | … |`)
5. `docs/INDEX.md` → Project Status, the parenthesis naming both versions

Structurally anchored: `scripts/audit/check-index-versions.py` plus the CI workflow `.github/workflows/data-integrity.yml`. Run `python scripts/audit/check-index-versions.py` locally before committing; exit 1 on drift, with a file:line annotation. Exit 2 means something else: a regex found no version at all, so one of the five places was reworded rather than misversioned. The two documentation regexes are deliberately bound to the exact wording, capitalization included.

**Bump required on content change (#154):** keeping the five places in sync is not enough. A completely *forgotten* bump (all places agreeing on the old version while the index content changed) would leave the cache stale for 30 days. Gate: `scripts/audit/check-index-version-bump.py --base <rev>` (CI step „Index-Versions-Bump-Gate" in `data-integrity.yml`) compares the decompressed index content against the diff base and demands a changed `version` string when it differs. A bump without a content change stays permitted (a deliberate cache flush).

**How to force refetch:**

| Method | What to change | When |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Corpus version bump | `INDEX_VERSION` in `corpus-loader.js` + `version` constant in `build-corpus-index.py` | After rebuilding corpus index with schema changes |
| Authority version bump | `AUTHORITY_INDEX_VERSION` in `corpus-loader.js` + `version` in `build-authority-index.py` | After rebuilding authority index with schema changes |
| User manual clear | "Alle Daten löschen" button on index.html | Clears all IndexedDB + localStorage |
| Developer clear | Browser DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → delete databases | Debugging |

### TEI File Cache (MHDBDB_TEI_Cache)

**Store schema:** `{ filename, xmlString, etag, lastModified, cachedAt, size }`

**Strategy:** Cache the raw XML string as delivered by the server, restore via `DOMParser`. This avoids re-downloading multi-MB TEI files on repeat visits.

**Freshness (#151):** `load()` sends a conditional GET (`If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` from the stored validators, `cache: 'no-cache'` to bypass the browser HTTP cache) – but at most **once per file per page load** (in-memory `revalidated` Set); later loads of the same file in the same session are pure IndexedDB hits with zero network. Server answers `304` → cached copy is served (one small roundtrip, `cachedAt` refreshed fire-and-forget); `200` → fresh content replaces the cached entry together with its new validators. Corpus updates therefore become visible on the **next page load**, not after a TTL. Entries without validators (legacy, pre-#151) trigger a full fetch once and are upgraded on write.

**Fallback to cache:** The cached copy is served with a console warning when the revalidation fails at network level (offline, 15s timeout via `AbortSignal.timeout`), when the server answers with an HTTP error (5xx/404 during a deploy window), or when a `200` body does not parse as XML (captive portal). A previously readable text therefore stays readable through server incidents.

**Expiration:** 30-day TTL is storage hygiene only: `cleanExpired()` runs in the background at `init()` (cursor over the `cachedAt` index, values never materialized) and purges entries not loaded/revalidated for 30 days – orphans of renamed or removed TEI files. Freshness is unaffected.

**Corruption handling:** If `DOMParser` returns a `parsererror` element for a cached entry, the entry is deleted; on the `304` path `load()` restarts and performs a plain full download.

---

## F. Authority Source Rules

**Contract:** When corpus annotation and authority files conflict, the corpus is authoritative. `lexicon.xml` and `variants.xml` are derived indexes, not the master.

**Why:** The corpus is edited continuously – both by script ingest and by manual correction (existing data is fixed, not only new data added). If the authority files were treated as master, legitimate corpus edits would be discarded as "errors" when in fact the authority is lagging behind. This rule stops a future session from misreading dangling refs as corpus errors instead of authority gaps to backfill. (#44/#115)

### F.1 Corpus Leads, Authority Follows

When a `<w>` carries a `@lemmaRef` / `@ana` / `@corresp` that does not exist in the target authority file – a **dangling ref** (detector: `scripts/audit/check-authority-cross-refs.py`):

- **Default:** the corpus annotation wins. The authority must gain the missing entry (lemma stub from form + `@pos`; variant via `extract-variants.py`).
- **Exception:** an obvious corpus typo (reference to a never-existing ID, single occurrence, a neighboring ID exists with the right form) is fixed in the corpus instead.
- `lexicon.xml` is never the master for the question "does this lemma exist?" – the corpus is.

### F.2 Sense Meanings Are Curatorial

A lemma *form* is generatable from the corpus (word form + `@pos`). A sense *meaning* (its `concepts.xml` assignment) is NOT – it is assigned manually by the team (KZW / Julia). A backfill can therefore only create lemma/sense **stubs**; the semantic classification stays curatorial handwork. Phase-3 ingest records (e.g. WZB) hold resolved-sense IDs but no semantic classification.

### F.3 Ingest Requires Backward Sync

Any ingest pipeline that mints new lemma/sense IDs in the corpus MUST write them into `lexicon.xml` atomically. A forward-only pipeline (annotate corpus without authority sync) produces dangling refs – exactly the WZB drift (#115): Phase 1b minted lemma IDs ≥78000 into the corpus, but no script backfilled `lexicon.xml`. Detector: `scripts/audit/check-authority-cross-refs.py --check` (CI gate in `data-integrity.yml`). Since #152 the tolerated legacy set is pinned as an **ID-set ratchet** in the committed `scripts/audit/lexicon-baseline.json`: any dangling lexicon id outside that set fails CI – including compensating drift (new ids introduced while old ones are backfilled in the same PR). New ids must either be backfilled immediately or deliberately added via `--update-baseline` (KZW decision, reviewable file diff); when backfill lands, run `--update-baseline` and commit the shrunken file so the ratchet keeps gripping (CI emits a `::warning` until you do). See [DECISIONS.md → ADR-015](DECISIONS.md#adr-015-authority-source-model-the-corpus-leads-ingest-needs-a-backward-sync). The full normative ingest procedure (Stage-0 conversion → Phases 1–3 → backfill) is documented in [DATA-MODEL.md → Ingest procedure](DATA-MODEL.md#ingest-procedure-taking-in-new-texts).

**Master of record:** Since the migration (2025-07-22) this repository is the *sole* master for all 8 authority files; there is no Salzburg re-export and no live external source. See [TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md → Provenance](TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES.md#provenance-and-currency).

### F.4 Work Identity: `works.xml` Leads, the TEI Header Mirrors

**Contract:** For the identifier types `handschriftencensus`, `GND` and `wikidata`, `authority-files/works.xml` is the master and the `msIdentifier` of each TEI header is a mirror. The mirror is not maintained by hand: `scripts/sync/sync_tei_headers.py --works` writes it, `--check` gates it in `data-integrity.yml` (#399). The gate fails on a content difference and equally on a file whose `msIdentifier` is missing or unparsable: `works.xml` carries identifiers for it either way, so a vanished block is the same drift as a wrong value.

**Why this is a mirror and not a reduction.** The header could carry only the sigle and resolve the rest through `@corresp`, and the surface does exactly that. It keeps the copy anyway, because this repository is called „The entire MHDBDB stored in TEI files only": a single downloaded `.tei.xml` has to stay citable on its own. Redundancy without a generator drifts, with one it does not; the same pattern already carries `variants.xml` (`extract-variants.py` plus a freshness step) and the injected nav and footer (`build-pages.py --check`).

**Resolution is by `@corresp`, never by sigle.** A sigle does not identify a work uniquely: TRO carries both `work_69` (Konrad von Würzburg's *Trojanerkrieg*) and `work_c7da236c-…` (the anonymous continuation), because `tei/TRO.tei.xml` contains both texts. Measured 2026-09-07: 667 of 667 corpus files carry `@corresp` on the `msIdentifier`, all 667 resolve to a work defined in `works.xml`, and exactly one differs from what the sigle would yield. Keying by sigle silently wrote the continuation's identifiers into TRO's header (#395).

**Two types stay header-owned and the generator never touches them:**

- `sigle` is the key, not a mirrored value.
- `mwb-sigle` is **per text witness, not per work**. The MWB assigns a separate sigle to each manuscript redaction (`NibA`, `NibB`, `NibC`, `NibD` in its Quellenverzeichnis), while `works.xml` only knows identifiers per work: `work_18` carries the four sigles NBB, NLA, NLB and NLC, and only NLC is `NibC`. Generated from `works.xml`, NLA would receive the sigle of the C redaction. The 19 values therefore stay in the header until the data model gains a level below the work.

`callNumber` and `ISBN` are the converse case: `works.xml` carries them (680 and 135), and they stay out of the `msIdentifier` because they describe the edition, not the work. The edition is already in the header, in the `biblStruct` of the `listBibl`.

**The writer edits text, not a parse tree.** `sync_tei_headers.py --works` replaces the mirrored `idno` inside the `msIdentifier` block by string replacement and leaves every other byte alone, including line endings (WZB is a CRLF file). Same reasoning as `scripts/audit/drop-negative-variant-corresp.py` and `scripts/sync/build-wbnetz-lemma-list.py`.

The older route through `etree.parse(remove_blank_text=True)` plus `tree.write(pretty_print=True)` is reachable only as `--bibl-struct`, and that restriction is not about formatting. Measured 2026-09-07: one such run changes all 667 files and shrinks the corpus from 1,432.5 to 1,430.6 MB, **and it loses data**. It deletes every non-sigle `idno` (`idno[@type!="sigle"]`), so the 19 `mwb-sigle` are gone (19 files before, 0 after on a corpus copy) and `works.xml` cannot give them back, because it never had them. It also changes the bibliography semantically in five files (AK, FR3, HZ, LUU, WZB), where the header carries entries `works.xml` does not have. The `--check` gate does not notice any of this, because it deliberately does not check `mwb-sigle`.

`--all` therefore routes `works` through the surgical writer as well. Until the review round of 2026-09-07 it fell into the old path silently, which would have deleted the 19 `mwb-sigle` with no gate saying a word: the invariant „the generator never touches `mwb-sigle`" held for the new path only, while the old one stood next to it looking like an option.

### F.5 Name Forms: the Historical Form Leads, the Modernized One Stays as an Alternative

**Contract:** where a person is attested under two name forms and both are defensible in the literature, `persons.xml` carries the historical or Middle High German form as `<persName type="preferred">` and the modernized one as `<persName type="alternative">`. Every other occurrence follows the preferred form. The alternative is never deleted: it is attested, and deleting it makes the person unfindable under the name a reader is likely to know.

**The exception, and it is not a contradiction:** where an authority file has settled the question, the preferred form follows the authority file even if that means the modernized form wins. GND and the *Deutsche Biographie* are the ones in use here.

**Decided by KZW on 2026-09-14 in [#308](https://github.com/DigitalHumanitiesCraft/mhdbdb-tei-only/issues/308)**, on two cases that look symmetrical and are not:

| Sigle | preferred | alternative | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| HHP | Heinrich von Pressela | Heinrich von Breslau | historical form kept, modernized place name as the variant |
| SJW | Jakob von Warte | Jakob von Wart | *von Warte* is the GND and *Deutsche Biographie* form; *von Wart* stays as attested |

**Why this needs writing down.** The two cases pull in opposite directions on cost, and cost is not the criterion. Counted across `persons.xml`, `works.xml` and `tei/` at the state before the fix (`origin/main`, 2026-09-14), with the rule that a name only counts where it is not the prefix of a longer one:

| Form | `persons.xml` | `works.xml` | `tei/` | total |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Heinrich von Pressela | 1 (preferred) | 2 | 4 | **7** |
| Heinrich von Breslau | 0 | 1 | 1 | **2** |
| Jakob von Warte | 0 | 3 | 4 | **7** |
| Jakob von Wart | 1 (preferred) | 0 | 1 | **2** |

For HHP the preferred form was also the more frequent one, so the rule was cheap. For SJW the preferred form was the *rarer* one, so following the decision meant changing the authority file rather than the corpus. **A session that reasons from "which form do we have more of" gets HHP right and SJW right for the wrong reason, and gets the next case wrong.**

Two notes on the counting, because both are easy to get wrong here. The prefix rule is not pedantry: without it every *Jakob von Warte* counts as a *Jakob von Wart* too, and the table reads 9 against 7 instead of 2 against 7, which inverts the argument. And the *Pressela* row differs by one from the count given in #308 on 2026-09-06 (6 there, 7 here, the extra occurrence in `tei/HHP.tei.xml`); the other three rows reproduce exactly. The difference does not touch the reasoning, and it is recorded rather than quietly corrected.

**Where "every other occurrence" actually is, and this is the expensive half.** A TEI header carries a person name at two places, not one: `titleStmt/author` and `particDesc/listPerson/person/persName`. The second one is a mirror of `persons.xml`, addressed by `@corresp`, present in 666 of the 667 files with 671 entries in total (measured 2026-09-14). Nothing writes it, and until #308 nothing read it either: `build-corpus-index.py` takes the author from the `titleStmt`, and no code outside `_archived/` and `ingest/` touches the block at all. The first application of this contract missed it and left `tei/SJW.tei.xml` contradicting itself after the correction, in the very line that #308 had named as the contradiction. Since then `scripts/audit/check-author-refs.py --check` holds the mirror against `persons.xml` and runs in `data-integrity.yml`.

A deviation there is categorically different from a deviation in the `titleStmt`, and the gate treats it so: a `titleStmt` author may legitimately differ from the preferred form (a bibliographic variant, a decision for a human), while the `particDesc` is a copy and a difference is always a stale copy.

**Practical consequence for a session:** when `check-author-refs.py` reports „Text weicht vom preferred-Namen ab", that is not automatically a corpus error. It is a question with two possible answers, and which one applies depends on whether a normdata file has an opinion. Look there first, and put the case to KZW when it does not. When it reports „Spiegel veraltet", there is nothing to decide: the header is behind.

This does not touch F.4: identifiers (`handschriftencensus`, `GND`, `wikidata`) stay generated from `works.xml`, name forms are not among them.

## G. Static JSON API Contract (#45)

**Contract:** The URL *schema* of the static API under `/api/` is stable; the *resources* follow the data. External consumers (MWB, Wörterbuchnetz, citing researchers) build URLs against the schema – breaking it silently breaks every external link.

**Why:** The API is plain files generated by `scripts/build-api.py` from the two indexes. Nothing at runtime enforces the URL structure or field shapes; only this contract and the CI freshness gate do.

### G.1 URL Schema Stability

- Path structure is **permanent**: `api/index.json`, `api/lemmata/index.json` (bundle only, no individual lemma files), `api/<coll>/index.json` + `api/<coll>/{id}.json` for `persons`, `works`, `concepts`, `genres`, `names`, `texts`.
- **No version prefix** (no `/api/v1/`). Schema changes are documented (here and in `api/index.html`), not versioned – additive changes are allowed, renames/removals of paths or fields are breaking and need an explicit decision.
- The `{id}` is the record ID exactly as in the indexes (`person_445`, `work_WZB`, text sigle `WZB`), filesystem- and URL-safe by build-time assertion (pattern check + case-insensitive uniqueness, Windows FS).

### G.2 Resources Follow the Data (no record permanence)

- An individual `{id}.json` exists exactly as long as the record exists in the source index. The build **wipes all `api/**/*.json` before writing** (orphan protection) – a removed record's file disappears, by design.
- There is **no promise of record permanence**, only of schema permanence. Removed states remain traceable via git history (the whole `api/` tree is committed).

### G.3 Field Schemas

- **Every emitted file** carries `"license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0"`. Collection indexes are `{"license", "items"}`.
- **Root manifest** (`api/index.json`): `project`, `license`, `contact`, `documentation`, `sources` (the two index versions – provenance for every consumer), `collections` (`href` + `count` each).
- **Summary list schemas** (`items[]` per collection): persons `{id, preferredName}`; works `{id, title, sigle}`; concepts/genres/names `{id, termDE, termEN}`; texts `{id, title, author, wordCount}`.
- **Full records** are the index records verbatim, plus `license`, with two transformations: `persons.works` is normalized from comma-string to a JSON array; texts are stripped of the heavy `words`/`lemmata`/`lineStarts`/`lineEnds` arrays (full token data stays in `data/corpus-index.json.gz` and `tei/`). Verbatim means additive index fields flow into the API automatically – e.g. lemma records carry `posAll[]` (every `<pos>` value; `pos` stays the first one) since Authority Index v1.6.0 (#161), and the curated fields `origin` (source languages + attribution) plus `senses[].definition` / `senses[].comment` since v1.7.0. The curated fields are **present only where curated** (1 lemma today) – consumers must treat them as optional, never as a schema promise per record. `origin.languages[]` is an **unordered set of origin layers**, source and transmission language alike; which is which is stated in the German prose of `origin.attribution`, not machine-readable. It is kept congruent with the language concepts in the `concept_23123000` subtree by curation rule (TEI-MODEL-AUTH-FILES §3.1), not by the build. The `*Resp` fields carry `contributors.xml#contrib_N` verbatim per §G.3's ref convention. Since Authority Index v1.9.10 (#270) each `senses[].commentResp` is accompanied by `senses[].commentRespName`, the display name resolved at build time from `contributors.xml`; it is present exactly where `commentResp` is. `definitionResp` and `origin.resp` stay unresolved, and `contributors.xml` is still not a collection of the index, so resolving those two IDs needs the XML file, not the API. Settled by [ADR-018](DECISIONS.md#adr-018-attribution-of-curated-lemma-statements-stops-at-the-data-layer-for-now) and its revision of 2026-09-23; the change was additive, no field was removed or renamed. Since v1.8.0 (#307) person records carry the same kind of optional pair: `altNames[]` (alternative name forms from `persons.xml`, present for 81 of 211 persons) and `altNormalized[]`. The two are **index-parallel by contract** – `altNormalized[i]` is `normalizeMHG(altNames[i])` – because the person explorer matches on the normalized entry and displays the readable one at the same position. A consumer that filters or reorders one list must do the same to the other. `@xml:lang` from the source is deliberately not carried: for a person both language forms name the same individual, so an alternative is a search key, not a display label (unlike concepts, where `termDE`/`termEN` are distinct labels and both get shown). One consequence to know before anyone asks for the language back: the dedup collapses the 34 cases where the German and English form are the same string, so a later parallel `altLangs[]` would have to carry a list per entry, not a single value.
- **Ref convention:** cross-references stay raw as in the source XML/indexes (`persons.xml#person_786`, `lexicon.xml#lemma_879_sense_1449`). Consumers parse the ID as the substring **after `#`**; the part before `#` names the source authority file, not an API path.

### G.4 Determinism = CI Gate Basis

Same committed index state → byte-identical `api/` output (no timestamps, no randomness, compact `json.dumps`, iteration in index list order – the #125 principle). This is what makes the CI check "Freshness API (#45)" in `data-integrity.yml` possible: rebuild + `git diff` (plain JSON, no decompression step). Anything non-deterministic added to `build-api.py` turns the gate into a permanent false alarm.

## H. Analysis Tools: Counting Rules (#281)

**Contract:** the tools below emit *numbers that can be cited*. Each number's counting rule is normative and must not be changed silently. A different reference corpus, a different denominator or a different threshold produces a different published figure from the same data.

**Why this section exists:** §A to §C cover the search chain, which is where wrong behavior is *visible*. Analysis output is different: a keyness value computed against the wrong reference corpus looks exactly like one computed against the right one. The rebuild test ("could I delete every `.js`/`.py` and reconstruct it from the docs?") failed for these four, while it passed for search, build pipeline and reader.

**Scope note that applies to all four:** none of them reads the corpus-search text selection. The main-site checkbox selection (`corpusData.includedTexts`) filters *search results*; every tool here works on the full corpus index and defines its own scope. This is intentional and is the single most misreadable property of the whole section.

### H.1 Keyness (signed log-likelihood, #114)

Source: `assets/js/app.js`, `computeKeyness()` and `logLikelihood()`. Rendered as a sortable column in the main-site table view, one value per result row (= per text).

**Contingency values** for a row belonging to text *T*:

| | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `a` | hits in *T* | `r.matchCount`, summed over all lemma IDs that matched in *T* |
| `b` | hits in the rest of the corpus | `corpusMatches - a` |
| `c` | **indexed** tokens in *T* | `text.wordCount` |
| `d` | **indexed** tokens in the rest of the corpus | `corpusWordTotal - c` |

"Indexed token" everywhere in §H means what `build-corpus-index.py` counts: a `<w>` that has an `@lemmaRef` **and** non-empty text content. `wordCount` is therefore not "words in the text". Within the statistic this is harmless, because `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` all use the same population. For anyone reconstructing it, it is not: reading `c` as "all `<w>`" produces a different value in every row, and it looks exactly like the right one.

```
# Reference corpus: ALL texts in the corpus index, never the user's selection.
corpusWordTotal = sum(text.wordCount for text in corpusIndex.texts)
corpusMatches   = sum(len(text.lemmata[id])
                      for id in lemmaIds
                      for text in corpusIndex.lemmaIndex[id])

logLikelihood(a, b, c, d):
    if c <= 0 or d <= 0 or (a + b) <= 0: return 0
    e1 = c * (a + b) / (c + d)
    e2 = d * (a + b) / (c + d)
    ll = 0
    if a > 0 and e1 > 0: ll += a * ln(a / e1)
    if b > 0 and e2 > 0: ll += b * ln(b / e2)
    ll *= 2
    return ll if (a / c) >= ((a + b) / (c + d)) else -ll
```

Four properties that are decisions, not implementation details:

1. **The reference corpus is always every text in the corpus index, independent of the text selection.** Deselecting texts changes which rows appear, never the value in a row. The code comment records this as the same reference used in Beutel-Thurow's naming-analysis; that comparability is asserted there, not verified against her data here.
2. **`c` and `d` are total token counts, not non-hit counts.** This is the Rayson/Garside form of the statistic (two-term sum over observed vs. expected), not a full four-cell table. Both are current practice; mixing them up changes every value.
3. **`lemmaIds` is the resolution of the search term, not the set of lemmata that actually produced hits.** Taken from `resolveLemmaIds(normalized(term))`, i.e. the same three-stage resolution the search itself used (§C). Using the hit set instead would make the reference frequency depend on the selection through the back door.
4. **Signing:** relative frequency in the text ≥ relative frequency overall → positive (overrepresented), else negative. Equality counts as overrepresented.

**Thresholds** (df = 1): 3.84 → p < 0.05, 10.83 → p < 0.001. Only 10.83 is used in the UI, as bold + brand color. `keyness` is `undefined` when no results or no index exist, and renders as `–`; sorting maps that to `-Infinity`.

### H.2 Hapax legomena (#196)

Source: `playground/js/ui/tei/hapax-legomena.js`. Scope: the full corpus, always.

```
# Corpus-wide LEMMA frequency, not word-form frequency
counts[lemmaId] = sum over all texts of len(text.lemmata[lemmaId])
entry qualifies  <=>  counts[lemmaId] <= maxFreq        # 1 | 2 | 3
```

- **The threshold is `<=`, not `=`.** "Hapaxlegomena (Frequenz = 1)" is the label for `maxFreq = 1`, where both readings coincide; Dis- and Trislegomena are cumulative (`<= 2`, `<= 3`), so each level contains the previous one.
- **The unit is the lemma, not the word form.** A lemma attested once, in an inflected form, is a hapax here. This is a lemmatized corpus, so lemma frequency is the only figure the index supports; a form-based hapax count would need the token layer.
- **At most 3 occurrences are retained per lemma** during aggregation (hard cap, in text and position iteration order). The display says "Angezeigt sind die ersten N von M Vorkommen" whenever the stored count exceeds them. For `maxFreq <= 3` the cap cannot truncate; it exists so the aggregation stays bounded.
- **Filter chain**, in this order: no authority entry (kept only when neither facet is set) → proper names (`hideNames`, default **on**, any tag `NAM`) → numerals (`hideNumerals`, default **on**, but only when `NUM` is the *sole* tag, so ADJ/NUM compounds survive) → function words (`hideFunctionWords`, default **off**, any tag in `FUNCTION_WORD_POS`, but lemmata with no tags at all are kept) → PoS facet → initial letter. An explicitly chosen PoS facet always overrides the identically named default filter.
- **The percentage in the header uses the unfiltered count** (`rawCount / totalTypes`), and "ausgeblendet" is `rawCount` minus the whole filtered list, not minus the visible page. So the headline figure describes the corpus, not the current filter setting.
- **Per-text tab counts distinct lemmata, not attestations:** `abs` = number of qualifying lemma IDs occurring in that text, `rel` = `abs / text.wordCount * 1000`. The denominator is indexed tokens (see H.1), and the numerator counts types while the denominator counts tokens, so `rel` is a types-per-thousand-tokens rate, not a share.

### H.2a What `lineEnds[]` actually points at (prerequisite for H.3 and H.4)

Both verse tools read `text.lineEnds[]` from the corpus index. Its definition is narrower than "end of verse" and is the main source of misreading:

- An entry exists **only for `<l>` elements containing at least one indexed word.** A verse whose tokens carry no `@lemmaRef` is absent from `lineEnds[]` entirely, and therefore from every count derived from it.
- The entry is the §B position of the **last indexed word** of that verse, not of the last word. If the final token of a verse is unannotated, `lineEnds[]` points at a word inside the verse, and what the rhyme tools treat as the rhyme word is not the rhyme word.
- Every position in `lineEnds[]` is guaranteed to have an ID in `words[]`: the index appends to `words[]` and to the line frame in the same step (`build-corpus-index.py`, single-pass `iterwalk`). Guards of the form `if (!lemmaId) continue` in the consuming code are dead code against a consistent index, not a filter.

**Multi-`@lemmaRef` status:** `words[pos]` stores the **first** ID only, while `lemmata` lists the position under every referenced ID. Measured 2026-07-31: the corpus holds **7,532,982** `<w>` elements with an `@lemmaRef`, and `sum(text.wordCount)` over the built index is the same number, so the non-empty-text guard removes none of them. Of those, **0 carry more than one reference.** Every place below where the two fields are said to diverge is therefore a latent property today, not a present distortion. It becomes real the moment an ingest introduces multi-reference tokens.

### H.3 Rhyme dictionary (#106)

Source: `playground/js/ui/tei/rhyme-dictionary.js`. Scope: full corpus, optionally narrowed by a free-text filter. All three fields are lowercased before comparison: sigle must match exactly, title and author match as substrings.

```
for each text with non-empty lineEnds[] and words[] and containing targetId:
    targetPositions = set(text.lemmata[targetId])
    for k in 0 .. len(lineEnds)-1:
        if lineEnds[k] not in targetPositions: continue
        for delta in (-1, +1):
            j = k + delta
            if j < 0 or j >= len(lineEnds): continue     # no wrap-around
            partnerId = text.words[lineEnds[j]]
            if partnerId == targetId and delta == -1: continue   # count self-rhyme once
            if rhymesWith(normalized[targetId], normalized[partnerId]):
                record pair (k, j)

rhymesWith(a, b):
    return a[-3:] == b[-3:]  or  (len(a) <= 4 and len(b) <= 4 and a[-2:] == b[-2:])
```

- **"Adjacent" means adjacent index in `lineEnds[]`**, i.e. the preceding and following *verse of the same text*, not adjacency by `@n`. The pairing assumption is the rhyming couplet. Cross rhyme (distance 2) is **not** captured, and the UI says so.
- **The two sides of a pair are read from different index fields, deliberately.** The target side uses `text.lemmata[targetId]` (all positions, so multi-`@lemmaRef` tokens count), the partner side uses `text.words[pos]` (the **first** ID only). A partner lemma that only ever appears as a second `@lemmaRef` would therefore be invisible (see H.2a: no such token exists today). Reading the target side the same way would silently drop target attestations, which is the worse error.
- **The rhyme criterion is graphemic, on MHG-normalized lemma forms**, not phonetic, and not on the original token. A partner without a lexicon entry has an empty normalized form and therefore never rhymes. It is a *heuristic*, explicitly a minimal variant; the full treatment (original tokens, phonetics) is parked in #109. The 2-character fallback is gated on both forms being short, otherwise high-frequency short words flood every target.
- Retained evidence per partner is capped at 1000 pairs; the displayed list is capped at 200 partners after the `minCount` filter.

### H.4 Verse-ending profile and "Reim-Druck" (#106 points 2 and 3)

Source: `playground/js/ui/tei/verse-ending-profile.js`. Scope: verse texts only (`lineEnds[]` non-empty), then all of them, or one author, or one text.

```
verseCount  = sum(len(text.lineEnds) for text in scope)
endCounts[l]   = count of verses whose last annotated word maps to lemma l   # from text.words[]
totalCounts[l] = sum(len(text.lemmata[l]) for text in scope)                 # from text.lemmata

shareOfVerses = endCounts[l] / verseCount * 100
rhymePressure = endCounts[l] / (totalCounts[l] or endCounts[l]) * 100
```

- **"Reim-Druck" is scope-local on both sides.** Numerator and denominator come from the same scope, so a value for one text answers "how often does this lemma land at the verse end *in this text*", not "compared to the corpus". At `scope = corpus` the denominator still excludes prose, because prose texts are filtered out before counting.
- **Numerator and denominator come from different index fields:** `endCounts` reads `text.words[pos]` (first `@lemmaRef` only), `totalCounts` reads `text.lemmata` (every ID). With multi-reference tokens present, the numerator could only ever lose attestations while the denominator stays exact, so the figure would be too *low*, never too high. Today the two fields agree (H.2a: 0 multi-reference tokens), so the value is exact. This is a property to preserve, not a defect to fix: an ingest that introduces multi-reference tokens silently biases this column downward.
- **The `|| endCount` fallback** in the denominator turns a missing total into 100 %. It cannot trigger from consistent index data (a verse-ending attestation is also an attestation) and exists as a division guard.
- `sum(shareOfVerses)` over all lemmata is **exactly 100 %** (up to rounding), because `verseCount` and `endCounts` are built from the same `lineEnds[]` entries and every entry has an ID (H.2a). The share is therefore a share of *annotated* verses; verses without a single annotated token are in neither number. Do not read it as a share of all verses in the text.
- Sorting is by `endCount` only, then truncated to `topN`. The optional function-word filter keeps lemmata with **no** PoS tags, same as in H.2. There is no facet override here: a chosen filter always applies.

### H.5 Normalized figures in the remaining tools

Five tools outside H.1 to H.4 produce derived figures. Each is simple enough that a formula suffices, but the **base of each ratio** is not obvious from the UI label, and most of them do not divide like over like.

```
# Word frequency, "relative Frequenz" mode      (word-frequency.js)
rel = count(lemma in scope) / totalTokens * 1000

# Lemma distribution, per text                  (lemma-distribution.js)
rel = len(text.lemmata[id]) / text.wordCount * 1000

# Concept distribution, per text                (concept-distribution.js)
rel = sum(len(text.lemmata[id]) for id in concept) / text.wordCount * 1000

# Verse-position search, "(N%)" per text        (verse-position-search.js)
ratio = positionsAtBoundary / len(text.lemmata[id]) * 100

# Text statistics, three columns                (text-statistics.js)
diversity    = uniqueLemmata / wordCount                 # type-token ratio
hapaxRate    = hapaxInText / uniqueLemmata
avgLemmaFreq = sum(len(text.lemmata[id])) / uniqueLemmata
```

Four properties that decide whether a comparison across texts is valid:

0. **Every denominator counts annotated tokens only, the share of annotated tokens differs per text, and what is missing is not a random sample.** `wordCount` and `totalTokens` count `<w>` elements carrying a `@lemmaRef` (§B). Measured 2026-07-31 with `scripts/audit/quantify-unannotated-tokens.py`: of **9,431,294** `<w>` elements, **1,898,312 (20.13 %) carry no `@lemmaRef`**; per-text coverage runs from **58.4 % to 100 %**, median **77.4 %**, 358 of 667 texts below 80 %.

   The size of the gap alone would be harmless. If the unannotated tokens were spread evenly over lemmata, a text annotated at 60 % would lose the same fraction from numerator and denominator, and every per-thousand rate would come out unchanged. **They are not spread evenly.** Of the 1,898,312 unannotated tokens, **1,868,921 (98.5 %) are homographs of forms that *are* annotated elsewhere** in the corpus, largely ambiguity cases the legacy system left alone (the audit script says "mutmasslich" and so should this: with 7.5 M annotated tokens, part of that overlap is a base-rate artifact). They cluster hard on high-frequency function words and pronouns: `in` (128,144), `ir` (111,958), `er` (101,242), `sî` (80,989), `man` (62,285).

   The bias on a rate for lemma *L* in text *T* is `coverage(L) / coverage(T)`, so the direction depends on how well *L* itself is covered relative to the text average, and it **inverts** for a lemma whose own forms sit in the unannotated set (exactly the deliberately skipped homographs of #189). For the content words people usually measure, coverage(L) is above the text average and a sparsely annotated text therefore *tends to* score higher, saying nothing about its style. Do not state that as a law: for `in`, `ir`, `er`, `sî` or `man` it is simply wrong.

   Where the effect was measured, the observed association points the same way. For the corpus-wide hapax tool's "pro 1000" column (whose numerator is also depressed by missing annotation, since an unannotated rare form is invisible as a rarity): Spearman r(coverage, rate) = **-0.17** over the 345 texts with at least 1000 tokens, and the median rate in the lowest coverage quartile is about twice that of the highest. Text length is not the driver: it correlates with coverage (+0.31) but not with the rate (+0.01), and the negative relation survives within each length tercile (-0.24 and -0.29 for the middle and long thirds; it vanishes for the short third). This is **consistent with the denominator effect dominating the numerator effect**, moderately and not uniformly. It is not proof of it: coverage is not randomly distributed over the corpus (genre, ingest era, verse against prose), and those confounds were not controlled. The mechanistic derivation above is the exact statement; this is the observation that it survives contact with the data. Reproduce with `scripts/audit/coverage-bias-check.py` (needs the CSV from `quantify-unannotated-tokens.py`).

   None of this is a defect of the formulas, which correctly answer "per thousand *indexed* tokens". It is the first thing to state when the numbers get quoted, and the reason the UI labels say "annotierte Tokens" since #309. **The same bias applies to keyness (§H.1)**, whose `c` and `d` are the same token counts; the sign there is harder to reason about because both corpus and text side are affected.
1. **`diversity` is a type-token ratio and therefore length-dependent.** TTR falls systematically as texts get longer, for mathematical reasons and not stylistic ones. Sorting the column across texts of very different length ranks by length as much as by vocabulary richness. Comparisons are only safe between texts of comparable size, or after a length-normalized measure replaces it.
2. **Most of these rates do not divide like over like**, and they fail to in three distinct ways:

   | Formula | Numerator counts | Denominator counts | Symmetric? |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | the three per-thousand rates | positions, i.e. **every** `@lemmaRef` | token slots (`wordCount`), i.e. the **first** ID only | no |
   | `avgLemmaFreq` | positions, every ID | **types** (`uniqueLemmata`) | no, and differently |
   | `diversity` | **types** | token slots | no, and differently again |
   | `hapaxRate` | types | types | **yes** |
   | `ratio` (verse position) | positions | positions, same list | **yes** |

   The per-thousand rates carry the same latent asymmetry H.4 records for rhyme pressure. With zero multi-reference tokens today (H.2a) both sides agree exactly; they diverge the moment that changes. `hapaxRate` and the verse-position `ratio` are unaffected in principle, not just today.

3. **The verse-position search is the symmetric counterpart to H.4 and worth knowing about.** It answers the same shape of question ("how much of this lemma's usage sits at a verse boundary?") but reads **both** sides from `text.lemmata`, deliberately and with a comment saying why (`verse-position-search.js:61-69`, the #170 review finding). Rhyme pressure in H.4 reads its numerator from `text.words[]`. After an ingest that introduces multi-reference tokens, the two views will report different percentages for the same lemma, and this is the reason: the verse-position figure is the correct one.

`hapaxRate` is a within-text rate over types and is unrelated to the corpus-wide hapax tool in H.2. The two answer different questions and their numbers must never be compared.

### H.6 Deliberately not here

The remaining tools carry no derived figure. Checked, not assumed: percentages that only size a progress bar do not count as output.

- **Plain counts over `text.lemmata`:** text comparison and co-occurrence ranking. They stay documented in prose in `docs/FEATURES.md`.
- **Already under contract elsewhere:** multi-lemma search (document, proximity and same-verse) is §C.2. Its data path over `lineStarts[]`/`lineEnds[]`, like that of the verse-position search, follows the definition in H.2a.
- **Curated external dataset, trivial counting rule:** the extended character-naming explorer (#59) reads its own prebuilt `data/naming-index.json.gz` and reports attestation counts verbatim from it. What needs documenting there is provenance, not arithmetic, and that sits with the attribution in the view itself.

If any of them grows a normalized, weighted or otherwise derived figure, it belongs in H.5.

**Open dependency:** #255 asks whether parallel witnesses should count as independent texts in these evaluations. All four rules above currently count a witness like any other text. Whatever #255 decides changes H.1 (`corpusWordTotal`, `corpusMatches`), H.2 (`counts`), H.4 (`verseCount`) and every base in H.5, and this section is where it has to be written down.

The size of the effect is now measured per tool by `scripts/audit/parallel-witness-bias.py`, which recomputes every rule above with and without the tokens inside a `<div type="parallel">`. Two results bear on any future decision and are recorded here because they constrain it:

1. **`<div type="parallel">` carries two different meanings, and `@n` is the only thing separating them.** Where `@n` is a running number the block hangs beside a base text, which is the case #255 describes. Where `@n` is a manuscript or work name (`Jenaer Liederhandschrift`, `Codex Manesse`, `Augsburger Sachsenspiegel`) it names a witness, and *in BRW and DL1* those blocks are the entire text: 100 % of indexed tokens sit inside one, so a filter that drops them deletes the text rather than de-biasing it.

   **The `@n` class is not itself the discriminator, though, and reading it as one is the trap.** DL2 carries three named blocks that hold 204 of its 3,936 tokens (5.2 %) beside a base text, so for DL2 the named blocks are exactly the #255 case. The two axes are independent: what decides whether excluding a block de-biases a text or erases it is the **share of the text** sitting in parallel blocks, not what `@n` says. An implementation should gate on the share and use `@n` only to say what a block *is*. The script reports both, together with the raw `@n` values, so the heuristic stays checkable instead of merely acting.
2. **A change in one text's tokens moves keyness in unrelated texts**, because `corpusWordTotal` and `corpusMatches` are corpus-wide. Dropping only the numbered blocks removes 0.126 % of the corpus, dropping every parallel block 0.441 %, and both shift keyness values in *other* texts across a significance band. How many depends on how many lemmata you probe, so these are lower bounds from a probe, not corpus totals: over the 50 most frequent lemmata per affected text, 45 values elsewhere change band in the numbered-only scenario and 168 in the full one; over the 200 most frequent, 112 and 441. What did hold across both probe sizes is the size of the individual shift outside the affected texts, which stayed under the 10.83 threshold the UI marks in the numbered-only scenario (7.6 and 7.8) while reaching 76.3 in the full one, where two texts also drop out of the table entirely.
